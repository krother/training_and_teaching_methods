Write a question on each, e.g.:</p><ul><li>What did you like about the course?</li><li>What should be improved?</li><li>What would you like to learn more about?</li><li>What will you use in practice?</li></ul><p>Give markers to course participants and let them roam around and write for about 10 minutes. As a result, you obtain feedback on your course and your group has the opportunity to express things that may have been left unsaid.</p><p>The four-corner method can be used for a number of purposes: Collecting information on a new topic, facilitating the transfer to everyday practice, or collectively looking for solutions to a problem. Here, I focused on the feedback aspect because I found standing up and moving gives students the energy to focus one last time after a long day.</p>
