A super quick energizer

    hmmmm
    HMMMM
    jump + "Bing!"


## How to do it

There are three Micro wave levels:

* Spread your arms in front of you, so they´re parallel to the ground and move your fingers like starting a wave and hum monotonously.
* Do Level 1) and aditionally turn around one time.
* Jump, raise your arm, point to the ceiling and make a noise like „bing!“
