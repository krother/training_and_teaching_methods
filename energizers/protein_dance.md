# Protein Folding Dance

***'theatre' version of a scientific model.***

Explain the basic interactions between different kinds of amino acids:

* basic
* acidic
* polar
* nonpolar

Prepare a set of cards with amino acid names that students can attach to themselves or hold. Students
form a covalent chain using their hands. Then everybody tries to resolve
the chemical forces of his amino acid: acidic search basic amino acids,
polars try to get to the outside, nonpolars to the inside.

As soon as there is a tangle, you stop and see what environment everybody wound up in.

This exercise was originally choreographed with professional dancers in
January 2006 by Sasha Waltz & Guests with Jan Saam as a dancing
experiment. It was thereafter executed with students and lay people as
well.

### Hints

This is an exercise for biology classes, but you may take the idea to develop other *choreography* models.
