When helping to prepare the programme for the <a target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"http://rupy.eu\">RuPy conference</a>. I came across the online tool <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">MindMeister</span> (<a target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.mindmeister.com/\">www.mindmeister.com</a>). In brief, I think it's a useful Mind Map editor.<br><br>I sketched my own training topics, grouped them, and exported a PNG image and a PDF in less than 15 minutes.<br><img src=\"http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/522/22101050.png\" width=\"600\"><h4>Advantages</h4>In particular, I see a few key advantages in MindMeister:<br><ul><li>You can quickly enter your ideas, e.g. during a meeting.</li><li>You can share the document with other people (like GoogleDocs).</li><li>You can regroup items, and the arrows adjust automatically.</li><li>It's free (there are paid plans for power users, too).<br></li></ul><h4>Competitors</h4>Lets also have a look at four alternatives:<br><ul><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">PowerPoint</span>: Yes, it is easy to draw all kinds of boxes in PPT. But you have to create all the connections explicitly. If you then want to rearrange things, you cannot do that quickly. And you cannot work simultaneously on the same document.<br></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">GoogleDocs:</span> Yes, it is <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">the</span> collaborative online editor good for many things. But it actually does not provide anything mind-map like. When managing 20+ items, you might miss a function to hide/show groups of items.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Whiteboard:</span> If your team is in the same room, a great place to do collaborative work, gather &amp; group items, edit something etc. Still, a quick vizualization tool can pay off if you want to preserve/communicate the results. I've seen many people make photographs of whiteboards after a brainstorming sessions, but I've never seen one of the pictures used again.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Paper:</span> For me, this medium has been unbeaten for the last 2100 years. It sucks in almost all aspects mentioned above: you cannot collaborate remotely, you can hardly edit, and when more than four people sit around the same sheet it is ridiculously impractical. In all other situations I'm inclined to say: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"Sorry programmers, try harder.\"</span><br></li></ul><br>Taken together, I think <a style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\" target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"www.mindmeister.com\">MindMeister</a> is a great collaborative Mind Mapping tool to support brainstorming sessions, sorting your own ideas, and have the result look nice most of the time. <br><br>Let me know if you use any other tool for mind mapping.<br>
