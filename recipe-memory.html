Place the cards upside-down on a table/whiteboard. Trainees take turns in uncovering a card and explain whatever is written there. This way, you can either <span style="font-weight: bold;">repeat</span> content, or collect existing knowledge. In any case, do not comment on the answers.<br></div><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br><div style="text-align: justify;">I haveused Memory for repeating content at the beginning and end of a lesson. At the beginning, it makes a great warm-up exercise. The memory cards are easy to prepare on-the-fly, so that you can repeat what was done during a workshop at the end of the day. <br></div><br><div style="text-align: justify;">The main advantage of Memory is that everybody gets to participate. Sometimes, participants feel encouraged to help each other, in which case you can lean back and watch comfortably.<br></div>
