# Preface

Teaching is one of the oldest cultural activities of mankind. Teachers leave a strong legacy. Teachers have been influential figures in history: Confucius, Plato, spiritual leaders and many others.

As a teacher, your job is to make someone learn.
You cannot force anyone to learn. It is the student who decides whether to learn or not. You can only offer something and make it look interesting.

For learning to succeed, the teacher-student relationship is one that requires mutual respect, benevolence and empathy. Because of that, successful teaching must be a genuine manifestation of love.
