# How to teach programming?

You are going to conduct a programming course, tutorial or workshop. Of course, you know programming well, but how about teaching? Isn't teaching something that you *just do*? Since you have little time, maybe you shouldn't bother with didactic theory. Instead, *just get the course running somehow* and debug things on the fly. But wait â€“ aren't *quick and dirty hacks* a bad idea when you are writing maintainable software? Isn't writing code a *craft*? There are best practices like writing clean code, testing, using version control and so on?

With teaching it is the same.

As a teacher, your job is to make someone learn.
You cannot force anyone to learn. It is the student who decides whether to learn or not. You can only offer something and make it look interesting.

Teaching programming is a craft, too. It has its own set of tools. This book helps you to become a better programming teacher. It contains time-tested techniques for teaching programming in an interesting way. I collected them during the past 18 years of teaching.

Whether you are preparing a new course from scratch or a lecturer looking for ideas to spice up your classes, this book might be useful for you.

For learning to succeed, the teacher-student relationship is one that requires mutual respect, benevolence and empathy. Because of that, successful teaching must be a genuine manifestation of love.
