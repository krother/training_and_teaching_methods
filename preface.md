# How to teach programming?

You are going to conduct a programming course, tutorial or workshop. Of course, you know programming well, but how about teaching? Isn't teaching something that you *just do*? Since you have little time, maybe you should skip didactic theory and *just get the course running*. But wait â€“ aren't you arguing *against* quick and dirty hacks in programming all the time? Isn't writing code a *craft*? There are best practices like writing clean code, testing, using version control and so on?

With teaching it is the same.

Teaching is one of the oldest cultural activities of mankind. Teachers leave a strong legacy. Teachers are influential figures in history like Confucius, Plato and Uncle Bob. As a teacher, your job is to make someone learn.
You cannot force anyone to learn. It is the student who decides whether to learn or not. You can only offer something and make it look interesting.

Teaching programming is a craft, too. It has its own set of tools. This book helps you to become a better programming teacher. It contains time-tested techniques for teaching programming in an interesting way. I collected them during the past 18 years of teaching.

Whether you are preparing a new course from scratch or a lecturer looking for ideas to spice up your classes, this book might be useful for you.

For learning to succeed, the teacher-student relationship is one that requires mutual respect, benevolence and empathy. Because of that, successful teaching must be a genuine manifestation of love.
