# Checklists

Things worth thinking about when preparing for a class / tutorial.

## Before the seminar

* Do you have set a realistic learning goal?
* Goal: Find *one* Simple Specific Symbolic Small action your participants will do during the course that promotes their learning
* Have you done content reduction?
* Are you using a concept map or another visual overview of your tutorial?
* Do you have a lesson plan that fits into the given time frame?
* Do you know something about the trainees’ abilities?
* Are you planning to ask students for their expectations?
* Have you reserved some time for repeating?
* At the beginning, don’t forget to say hello.

## Written material and slides

* A good one-page handout can help a lot when used during a tutorial, often more than a thick stack of paper.
* For beginners, less is more. This applies to all material, especially electronic.
* Reading takes time – this is why longer text has a better place in a reader for taking home.
* Use a maximum 7 bullets per PowerPoint slide.
* Show each PPT slide for at least 2 minutes.
* Use lots of white space.
* Think about the lingo of your trainees. What background do they have? Does your tutorial contain concepts that need explanation?

## Equipment

* Marker pens + paper cards do wonders. With them, it is not that difficult to improvise exercises where people can actively participate.
* Useful acessoires for that are also glue tape, magnets (for attaching stuff on a white board), and scissors.
* A big roll of paper can be used by trainees to draw posters, mind maps, or results in pairs or small groups (paper is cheaply available e.g. at IKEA).
* Can you use 2D or 3D models to support your topic?

A trainers toolbox should include:

* good pens
* cards
* a few prepared posters/slides
* list of methods
* sticky dots
* something to randomly assign groups
* sweets
* ball or throwable item
* painters tape
* scissors
* timer
* pins
