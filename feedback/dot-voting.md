# Dot Voting

Which topics in a course should be revisited, repeated, or explained in more depth? In many courses, I let participants choose from up to 50 possible options within five minutes. Here is how:

### How to do it
Using sticky dots you can find out quickly what is most relevant to your students. You need to:

1. Visualize all available topics on paper cards or a board.
2. Explain the task, e.g. *“Stick dots on topics we should repeat tomorrow.”*
3. Distribute 3-5 dot stickers to each participants. Students will stick on their dots by themselves.

The entire procedure should take less than five minutes. 

### Advantages
The dot voting procedure works with flipchart paper, cards on a pin board or even post-its. On a big pin wall, you can vote on 50 items simultaneously. You are not restricted to dot stickers. Magnets and even making crosses with pens works well.

### Caveats
It is better to explain the task first and then distribute the dots. Otherwise it creates disturbance.

### What else?
Dot voting works in many different moderation scenarios, not only in teaching. You can find an alternative description on [www.gamestorming.com/core-games/dot-voting/](http://www.gamestorming.com/core-games/dot-voting/).

Dot voting is also used frequently on **Unconferences**, where it scales up to 100 participants and more.

Dot stickers make voting more interactive. The beauty of this method is that, in contrast to a poll with raising hands you give your participants time to think. Also there is a haptic component - you put responsibility literally into the hands of your participants.
