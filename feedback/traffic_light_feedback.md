# Traffic Light Feedback

*Collect quick feedback in a large group*

1. Every participant gets a red, yellow and green card
2. One participant formulates a statement regarding the course
3. Others indicate their level of agreement (green=full, yellow=partial, red=none)
4. Repeat
5. Stop before it gets dull (about 10 statements are sufficient).
