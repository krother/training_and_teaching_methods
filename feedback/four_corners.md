| summary     | collect feedback on 4 questions |

## How it is done

Hang 4 sheets of flipchart paper on different spots of the room. Write a question on each, e.g.:

* What did you like about the course?
* What should be improved?
* What would you like to learn more about?
* What will you use in practice?

Give markers to course participants and let them roam around and write for about 10 minutes. As a result, you obtain feedback on your course and your group has the opportunity to express things that may have been left unsaid.

## Comments
