# More Feedback Methods

![guest book](../images/guestbook.jpg)

*Over 4 years, I brought a guest book to all my trainings to collect comments and autographs of participants. Originally, I wanted to squeeze some constructive feedback out of the participants. In the end, it turned out to be a – much nicer – collection of memories and drawings. But it's still feedback.*

## Normative and Formative Feedback

There are two main types of feedback:

**Normative Feedback** – to fine-tune a course while it is running:

* find out what to prepare for the next lesson
* find out what your participants learned
* make your participants aware of what they learned
* improve a future edition of your course
* help participants to close the course mentally

**Formative Feedback** – collect more objective information to benchmark different courses against each other. Also see [Formative Assessment methods](https://www.edutopia.org/groups/assessment/250941).

Most of the methods in this chapter you find my favourite methods.

## Other methods

Things I did not write out in detail or haven't tried yet:

| technique | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Questionnaire | Share and collect a sheet with questions. Very formal but accurate feedback. Provides the best values when other trainers get the same questionnaire and you can compare results. |
| Scale | Participants locate themselves on a scale 0-100% towards their goal pre and post |
| Review expectations | If you collected written expectations at the beginning of the course, review them together at the end |
| Fridge | Take a round answering a question *"What would you tell your (fridge/cat/kids) about the training day?"* |
| Tandem | share personal takeaways and goals in pairs |
| Free drawing | Place a sheet of flipchart paper on a table and ask participants to write or draw a summary of the course. |
| 1 Up, 1 Down | participants alternate positive and critical comments, without repetitions |
| Speedboat | every coach knows this one, google it |
| Headlines	| write a one-line news title on the question of the day |
| Postcards | pick a postcard that expresses your mood and explain why |
| Treasure box | collect hints for the follow-up course |
| Hot or Not | ask about pairs of items: which is more important -> priorities |
