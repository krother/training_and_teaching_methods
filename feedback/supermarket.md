### Comments

As a result, you get feedback focused on the actual contents **and** its practical applicability. I find it a great way to filter out background noise, e.g. the atmosphere was nice etc.

If you like, you can bring props into which participants drop notes with their suggestions, e.g. a basket (*and .. er.. a freezer*).
