# Feedback Methods

| technique | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Questionnaire | Share and collect a sheet with questions. Very formal but accurate feedback. Provides the best values when other trainers get the same questionnaire and you can compare results. |
Dot Voting | Stick dots or place tokens in order to prioritize topics. See [www.academis.eu/posts/dot-voting](http://www.academis.eu/posts/dot-voting). |
Review expectations | If you collected written expectations at the beginning of the course, review them together at the end. See [www.academis.eu/posts/collect-and-review-expectations-your-students](http://www.academis.eu/posts/collect-and-review-expectations-your-students). |
Fridge | Take a round answering a question *"What would you tell your (fridge/cat/kids) about the training day?"* |
Free drawing | Place a sheet of flipchart paper on a table and ask participants to write or draw a summary of the course. |

## Online feedback tools

Easy to evaluate, but less immediate than a questionnaire on paper. To prevent your survey landing in the trash bin allocate time before the end of the training to fill the form.

## Guest book

I have a guest book I bring to most of my trainings to collect comments and autographs of participants. There are many other ways to collect feedback at the end of a lesson or course. In this table you find my favourites.

### Useful questions

Questions you might ask after a training (e.g. using the *four-corner* method include:

* What did you like about the training?
* What frustrated you?
* What did you find exciting?
* What are you going to try next?
* What are your wishes for the next day/session?
* What can you apply right away?
* What did you find difficult to understand?
* What would you like to learn more about?
* What else would you like to learn?
* What would you like to tell the trainer?
