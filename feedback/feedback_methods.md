# Feedback Methods

![guest book](images/guestbook.jpg)

I have a guest book I bring to most of my trainings to collect comments and autographs of participants. There are many other ways to collect feedback at the end of a lesson or course. In this table you find my favourites.

| technique | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Questionnaire | Share and collect a sheet with questions. Very formal but accurate feedback. Provides the best values when other trainers get the same questionnaire and you can compare results. |
Online Survey | Easy to evaluate, but less immediate than a questionnaire. To prevent your survey landing in the trash bin allocate time before the end of the training to fill the form. My favourite site for creating surveys is [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/). |
Voting Box | Collect cards with silent feedback. See [www.academis.eu/posts/collect-feedback-voting-box](http://www.academis.eu/posts/collect-feedback-voting-box). |
Dot Voting | Stick dots or place tokens in order to prioritize topics. See [www.academis.eu/posts/dot-voting](http://www.academis.eu/posts/dot-voting). |
Fist to Five | Students show zero to five fingers to rate the quality of the lesson or their learning succes. See [www.academis.eu/posts/recipe-fist-or-five](http://www.academis.eu/posts/recipe-fist-or-five) |
Mobile Feedback | Mobile phone apps like [Tweedback](http://twbk.de) and [Socrative.com](http://socrative.com) for online questions. |
Light my Fire | Participants take turns commenting on the course for the duration of a burning match. |
Supermarket | Quick feedback on the whiteboard. See [www.academis.eu/posts/four-corner-feedback](http://www.academis.eu/posts/four-corner-feedback) |
Traffic lights | Hand out 3 red/yellow/green cards, participants take turns in making a statement about the course and show their agreement by holding up a card. |
Review expectations | If you collected written expectations at the beginning of the course, review them together at the end. See [www.academis.eu/posts/collect-and-review-expectations-your-students](http://www.academis.eu/posts/collect-and-review-expectations-your-students). |
Fridge | Take a round answering a question *"What would you tell your (fridge/cat/kids) about the training day?"* |
| Four Corners | Participants collect answers to a different question in each corner of the room. See [www.academis.eu/posts/four-corner-feedback](http://www.academis.eu/posts/four-corner-feedback) |
Free drawing | Place a sheet of flipchart paper on a table and ask participants to write or draw a summary of the course. |

### Useful questions

Questions you might ask after a training (e.g. using the *four-corner* method include:

* What did you like about the training?
* What frustrated you?
* What did you find exciting?
* What are you going to try next?
* What are your wishes for the next day/session?
* What can you apply right away?
* What did you find difficult to understand?
* What would you like to learn more about?
* What else would you like to learn?
* What would you like to tell the trainer?
