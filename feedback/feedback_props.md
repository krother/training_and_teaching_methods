## Preparations

Bring a set of different objects, e.g.:

* smiley ball
* heart
* brain
* globe 
* spiky ball
* sports ball

Arrange all objects in a box.

## How to do it

1. Prepare one question related to each object
2. One participant picks an object
3. Trainer asks the question
4. Two more people get the same object
5. Next object

## Example questions

| object | question |
|--------|----------|
| smiley | What was fun for you during the training? |
| heart  | What did you like about the training? |
| brain  | What are your thoughts right now? |
| globe  | Where can you apply what you learned outside? |
| spiky  | What was inconvenient for you? |
| sporty | How did you perceive the group? |
