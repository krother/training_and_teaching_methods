## How to do it?

1. After each training module, ask: *"How much did you learn during the lesson? Please show one to five fingers. Raise your hands!"*
2. Count how often each number of fingers occurred.
3. Keep track of the numbers

With this method, trainees feel more encouraged to provide critical feedback than if you would simply ask:

*"did you understand it or not?"*

The counting itself needs a bit of exercise to do it quickly. When using the Fist or Five technique for the first time in 2012 with a group of 20, we asked for each number from zero to five separately.

The main value of the Fist or Five technique is that it is easy to execute, it is quantitative, it is immediate and can be repeated many times during a course. I hope you will see lots of 'high fives' in your next course!

## Comments from participants:

*"It is a good feedback and it is immediate. Although I feel sometimes a little bit shy to express my opinion."*

*"I like it because it makes me think. It forces me to review and figure out whether I understood the subject or not and how much. It also shows you are interested."*

*This method was explored in detail by Allegra Via, Kristian Rother and Pedro Fernandes.*

## Variation: Traffic Light Feedback

1. Every participant gets a red, yellow and green card
2. One participant formulates a statement regarding the course
3. Others indicate their level of agreement (green=full, yellow=partial, red=none)
4. Repeat
5. Stop before it gets dull (about 10 statements are sufficient).
