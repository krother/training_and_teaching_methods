The Craft of Teaching
=====================

When you are reading this book, I assume you are teaching a programming
course, tutorial or workshop. I also assume you know a thing or two
about programming, at least more than your students.
How will you prepare for your next teaching encounter? 
You might do the following:

1. prepare slides with theory and code examples
2. present the slides in class
3. see what questions you can cover in the time given

Imagine you would apply a similar approach to programming:

1. write code
2. run it
3. debug things on the fly

You probably know that **developing software is more than writing and
running code!** Programming is a craft. The craft of programming
includes practices such as version control, data modeling, testing and refactoring.
Every professional programmer needs such practices in order to produce clean,
maintainable code.
However, a beginner programmer is not aware that a skill called refactoring even exists.
Where the experienced programmer sees an unclear build process, a broken data model and a lack of tests,
all a beginner sees is code and error messages.
The beginner programmer needs to learn the craft first.

With teaching, it is the same.
