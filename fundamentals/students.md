# What Students are looking for

The first and last thing to keep in mind as a teacher are your students.
Students are the main ingredient of any teaching.
Everything else (including yourself) is dispensable, but without students, there is no learning.
With a working student-teacher relationship everything else becomes much easier.
Students that trust you usually contribute much more actively to your lessons.
They are also more forgiving of the many little mistakes you will inevitably make.
To earn their trust, it helps to address their needs.
In this chapter, we will take a closer look at what students are looking for.

## Facts

    "How can I implement a function?"

The technical skill is the predominant interest in most programming classes.
After all, students came to learn something.
Obviously, this is the primary focus of most programming classes.
But it is very rare that this is the *only* need of a participant.

## Guidance

    "What should I learn next?"

Participants who already have some programming experience often want to continue learning by themselves.
They want to explore the details independently, but feel overwhelmed by the variety of options.
These students are looking for guidance what to focus on.
I frequently found it is best to give such a student the name of a programming concept, library or some other keyword.
Frequently they come back with impressive examples a few days later that can be shared with the entire class.

## Feedback

    "Is my code OK?"

Participants who are new to a technology often feel a bit lost.
Reassurance is needed a lot by students who struggle with debugging.
Feedback in the form of code reviews is very useful, if you have the time for that.
But very strong programmers are sometimes looking for reassurance, too, especially if they already know another programming language.
They are actively looking to clear misconceptions they have.
A typical comment that helps them could be something like:

    "Yes, your functions are very well structured.
    But in Python we usually do not end every line with a semicolon."

## Community

    "I want to see what others do."

A programming course is a social marketplace and an opportunity to build your network.
Some students come with very project ideas and look for cooperation partners.
Most are social learners who want to work on assignments together.
To satisfy this need, it also helps to point out where students can connect to the programming community after the course.

## Real-world Solutions

    "I want to move my project forward."

Some course participants attend a course, because they have a real-world project to work on.
This need is usually very strong, regardless whether it is a Bachelor thesis or a complex industry application.
With this type of particpant, it pays off to find out early on what the project is about.
You can make them very happy with a conversation on the side and pointing out what parts of the course will be most useful for them.

## Inspiration

    "I want to learn how it is to work as a developer."

An emerging programmer might be looking for ways to move their career development forward.
They might need less technical advice, but more career advice, examples job profiles and role models.
A student interested in a career as a programmer will listen carefully to stories about projects  you have worked on.

----

## Recognition

    "I want to get the certificate to apply for jobs."

Many participants take a course, because they want something they can put on their CV.
All kinds of certifications, exams and other formal recognition are a core need.
For some participants, recognition is really important, but this need rarely gets in the way.

----

## Fun

    "I want to have a good time!"

Every participant appreciates a course that is enjoyable.
Working on fun programming exercises, having an entertaining instructor and a group in a good mood are general qualities of a great course.
But it is noteworthy that for some participants having a good time is the *only* need. (There is a grumpy subtype of a participant that has to take the course although they don't want to â€“ these can be a bit difficult to deal with).

----

As a teacher, you will be better at meeting some of these needs than others.
It is OK to be bad at some, and to tell your students.
They will find out quickly what you can provide for them.
Being clear what needs you are good helping with helps you establish a healthy student-teacher relationship.

## Reflection Questions

* How big is the group? Does that make preparations rather easy or challenging?
* What can you learn about your participants before preparing?
* How heterogeneous or homogeneous is the group?
* What is their previous state of knowledge?
* If you have taught a group already, can you assume they can do everything from the previous lesson?
