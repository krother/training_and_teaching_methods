# The Teacher

Let's take a look at the person of the teacher.
You are a central element of the teaching machinery, both compiler and runtime environment of a lesson.
In this chapter, I cover skills and personality traits of a good teacher.

When interviewing teacher candidates, I am looking for six different areas.
Half of them are technical skills, the other half are personality traits.
Let's start with the technical part:

----

### 1. Subject Matter Expertise

A programming teacher needs to know programming.
This is usually the first thing prospective teachers think of.
For a junior programming teacher, knowing the subject well is really important to feel comfortable in class.
But in my opinion, experienced programmers tend to overrate their expertise a bit.
First of all, a teacher is rather a generalist. In a generic course on programming, data analysis or similar, you need to know the basics well.
Second, the field of IT evolves quickly and your will find yourself learning along with your students.
Third, it is OK for a programmer not to know everything. That is a crucial message to convey to students.

There are of course scenarios where in-depth knowledge is important, e.g. when you are specifically invited as an expert on e.g. *"two-factor authentication"* and you will get sophisticated questions from other experienced programmers. Also, in an academic lecture you may be expected to connect to the latest research. But you may find yourself in a tradeoff between detail and being understandable, and I believe a teacher should always prefer the latter.

### 2. Teaching methods

A programming teacher needs to know how to teach.
This is a tricky one. Most programming teachers I have worked with, including myself, do not have a formal background in education.
A software developer who becomes teacher most likely has misconceptions what *"know how to teach"* means.
Such misconceptions manifest in beliefs like *"teaching is a talent you are born with"* or that teaching is a skill somehow inferior to programming.
To me, *"knowing how to teach"* means knowing **teaching methods**.
A teaching method is a tool that you can use during a lesson or preparation.
For instance, a **slide presentation** is a teaching method, a **multiple choice question** is another.
An exerienced teacher knows hundreds of methods.
A beginner teacher should have a few that they are comfortable with.

A programming teacher needs teaching methods for:

* preparing lessons
* engaging classroom activities
* presenting content
* designing exercises
* backup procedures when unexpected things happen

Most of this book build your repertoire of teaching methods.

### 3. Leadership skills

Teaching is a leadership role.
There are many *"people skills"* that have nothing to do with the actual content or its delivery.
If you are teaching a class for more than a day, you need to form a team, grow, encourage and support your participants.
You need to let them make mistakes and console them when they feel overwhelmed.
You need to promote fairness and equality and protect participants from major roadblocks.
You may need to act as a referee when conflicts occur.

All of these are classical leadership skills you may also find in a management role.
The stakes in teaching are maybe not as high as in a project worth millions.
But teaching a group over a longer time has a lasting impact on their life and career.

### 4. Passion

Let's continue with the first personality trait. A teacher needs *passion for their subject*.
You need it to ignite and inspire your students that what you do is actually interesting.
Finding something you find fun doing, even if it is not your favourite topic is a useful ability.

A teacher also needs *passion for teaching*.
I am a bit critical of the phrase, because I read it in applications a lot.
It usually meant that the applicant had very little methodical teaching knowledge.
But they got something fundamental right: you need to care about teaching.

In my opinion the passion for teaching means that you have genuine love for human beings, to help and enable people, even if you don't like them a lot, or won't ever see them again.
This love for human beings goes a long way to build a respectful teacher-student relationship.

### 5. Resilience

Teaching is a demanding profession. Your person is in the center of attention all the time.
You are responsible for everything, and on top of it you are on your own. There is often not much room to interact with other teachers, because they, too, are gone teaching. Consider yourself lucky if you have the opportunity to teach together with someone else. But most of the time, the job is a bit lonely.

You need to have self-defence mechanisms that prevent you from exhausting yourself.
Especially as a beginner, it is hard to not over-prepare (and to overwork), because nobody tells you when a lesson is *"good enough"*. Watching your working hours is generally difficult.
Take care to maintain a healthy life outside teaching.

When you teach people over a longer time, the challenge is to find the right distance to your students. On one hand you care about them, and want to establish a good relationship. On the other hand they will be gone, so you don't want to get emotionally too attached to them. Also, you may have to make hard decisions (e.g. failing exams), so don't treat them as your *"friends"* because you are not theirs.

----

### 6. Humility

As a teacher, you are the least important person in the room.
It is all about the student. As long as it works for them, you can forget everything else.
You want to grow your students to become better than you thought possible.
To allow them to surpass your expectations, you must allow yourself to be imperfect. If you convey, or even *think* your skills are out of their reach, you are denying them the chance to become better.
After all, you are looking up stuff on StackOverflow, are you?

Do not judge what your participants should or should not do. You cannot read their minds. Give them encouraging exercises and helpful feedback and earn their trust. You cannot force them to learn either. It is the student who decides whether to learn or not. The only thing you can do is to decide what is on the menu, propose something and make interesting. And to try again and again if it didn't work.

Do not judge whether your students are fit to be programmers either. I have written useful programs with 10000 lines and with 10 lines. Who knows what programming skills we will need in the future? Is it enough to have computational literacy? Is everybody going to be a programmer? Or nobody? Prepare your students as good as you can and let them find out as the future unfolds.

If you are a great, inspiring teacher, it will take years for your students to fully blossom. You will not see the fruit of your work (or even be rewarded for it). Knowing that you weave a legacy is what makes teaching so rewarding. But don't take yourself too serious. It takes all the fun away.
