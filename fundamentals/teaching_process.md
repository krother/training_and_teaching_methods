# The Teaching Process

In this chapter, we will look at teaching as a two-step process.
First, you prepare a lesson – you write the source code.
Second, you deliver it in the classroom – you execute it:

* Step 1: Prepare a lesson (write the code)
* Step 2: Deliver the lesson (execute)

**Remark:** *In teaching you will modify the source code while it is running, this is why I use interpreted languages as an analogy.*

We can formalize this code-execute process more:

* During **lesson preparation**, you consider the **setting** in which your lesson takes place (*aka requirements*)
* You write a **lesson** for that particular setting (*aka source code*).
* Then you **deliver** the lesson
* The output of the lesson is (hopefully) **learning progress**.

In this chapter, we take a closer look at what the setting consists of.
In the next chapters, we focus on the preparation.
The rest of the book is about the delivery.

## The setting

Let us look at the the setting in which your lessons take place.
Like the requirements of a program, the setting determines much of what happens in class. You cannot influence most of your teaching environment, but you need to know it to prepare accordingly.

### Participants
Your **participants** (students, learners or however you want to call them) are the main ingredient of any teaching. Everything else (including yourself) is dispensable, but without participants, there is no learning. In chapter **Facilitating your group** you will learn how to handle these important people.  

### Teacher
You (or whoever will deliver the lesson) have something to say as well. What works for one teacher does not work for another. If there are multiple teachers or you don't even know who will execute your lesson, the outcome will change again. This entire book is there to help you.

### Syllabus
Sometimes you get a list of topics you are expected to cover. However, usually nobody tells you how much of each topic to cover exactly.
A syllabus is raw material that requires work before lessons emerge from it. Often you may modify your syllabus or write it from scratch, which is a good first step before you start with the real preparation. You find more about how to use a syllabus in the chapters **Goals** and **Concept Maps**.

### Time
Time determines what you can do in a lesson and what you cannot. How long is your lesson? At what time of day does it take place? Are your lessons taking place in regular intervals or day after day? We will discuss time in chapter **Preparing Lessons**.

### Room
The location at which you teach and the room layout has a strong influence on the resulting lesson. Tables and laptops act as communication barriers that provide psychological safety but also make it more difficult to establish a dialogue.

What is the room layout? What equipment do participants have? What media do you have to visualize things in class? For a list of aspects to think about, see the chapter **Checklists**.

At least a few of these input parameters will change every time.

## What is learning progress?

**Learning progress**, the main output of your lesson, may consist of several things:

* knowledge your participants gained
* knowledge you gained
* artifacts: programs, diagrams, tables, posters
* feedback
* external goals: exams, grades and certifications

Of these, *"knowledge your participants gained"* is what you really want, but it is very hard to measure.
On the other hand, *"external goals"* are the easiest to measure, but they are the least useful.
The rest is somewhere in between

## Teaching is a cyclic process

During a course, the initial two steps become a cycle: You prepare, you deliver and repeat.
Even beyond that, teaching is inherently cyclic: the learning progress of one lesson becomes the setting of your next lesson.
The learning progress of one course becomes the setting of the next course.

From that it should be obvious that no two lessons are the same.
We are unable to prepare a course a priori and leave it unchanged, because the setting will change all the time.
So while we can hope to recycle some parts of our source code, we have to create a new, unique composition every time.
We are never done.

This is part of the reason why teaching is fulfilling.
