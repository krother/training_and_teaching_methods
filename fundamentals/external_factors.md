# External Factors

Programming courses are very sensitive to external factors.
Like the requirements of a program, these factors determine much of what happens in class.
You have little influence on your teaching environment, but you knowing the constraints help you to prepare accordingly.

In this chapter, you will find checklists of things that you need to know before preparing.

## Syllabus

Sometimes you get a syllabus â€“ a list of topics you are expected to cover.
A syllabus is raw material for creating lessons.
Usually, nobody will tell you how much of each topic to cover exactly.
That means you have a good deal of flexibility to emphasize topics you find important or can do well.

Sometimes you are expected to write a syllabus from scratch first, or negotiate it with the organizers.
This is a useful step before preparing lessons.
In the chapters **Goals** and **Concept Maps** you find methods to process a syllabus.

## Formal requirements

Whoever is organizing the course, may have specific things you are expected to do.
These can influence what happens in the classroom quite a bit, so you want to find out as early as possible.
Here are a few things to look out for:

* Are you required to track attendance?
* Is there a feedback process?
* Are there mandatory exercises for the students?
* Is there material you are expected to use?
* Are there any copyright claims on material you create? *(this should be made expensive)*
* Are catering or socializing events planned?
* Are there security restrictions? *(e.g. in regarding installable software)*
* Are there any hygienic / social distancing restrictions?

----

## Time

Time determines what you can do in a lesson and what you cannot. Factors to consider:

* How long is your lesson?
* At what time of day do you start? (in the morning, students can digest twice the content of an evening)
* Are lessons on consecutive days or once a week? (in the latter case, you need more time for repeating)
* Are there fixed lunch times?
* Do you need to finish on time because another teacher takes over?
* Are there any exams, difficult lessons or bar crawls before you start?

## The Classroom

The room in which you teach has a strong influence on the resulting lesson.
For instance, the room layout creates a more or less communicative setting.
Also, tables increase the psychological safety but also make it more difficult to establish a dialogue.
At least a few of these input parameters will change every time.

* What is the room layout?
* How is the atmosphere? *(cozy, empty, friendly, neutral, ...)*
* Are there any visual obstacles? *(huge screens, pillars)*
* Where is the door? *(do stragglers pop into the middle of your show?)*
* Can you move around freely to help the partipants?
* Are there enough power sockets/extension cables?
* What media are present? *(whiteboard, projector, flipchart, pin boards)*
* What adapter does the projector have? *(ask twice, this one can be a showstopper)*
* Do the pens work? *(default is `no`, bring a spare pen)*
* How are the acoustics? Do you have to talk very loudly? Is there an echo?
* Do you need a microphone?
* Are there loudspeakers? *(for yourself or for playing audio)*
* Where is the light coming from? Are there blinds in case of sun glare?
* How to open the windows / turn on the air condition?
* Can you move tables?
* Do participants have fixed seats?
* Is it possible to arrange chairs in a circle or half-circle? Can you do it quickly?
* Is there space for a group conversation? (*sometimes the garden or courtyard will do*)
* Is there space for breakout sessions?
* Are participants allowed to eat/drink in the room?
* Are drinks/food in the room already?
* Where is the first-aid kit?
* Where are the emergency exits?
* Who can you call if something does not work?

## Online Teaching

In case you are teaching online, you need to check the virtual classroom instead.
Many of the following apply to a on-site course as well:

* What online platform will you use to communicate with students? Have you used it before?
* Are students expected to have their cameras on?
* How stable is the internet connection? Are there occasional drop-outs?
* Are there etiquette that the students have been using?
* Do you need to admit people manually to the virtual classroom?
* Can you split the group into breakout sessions?
* Is there a Learning Management System (LMS) in place?
* How can you exchange files with the participants?
* How can you exchange chat messages with the participants?
* Who can you call if something does not work?

----

## Computers

For a programming course, you usually want to have at least one computer.
There are several things to check about computers and hardware:

* **What is the Wifi password?**
* How many computers per participant are there?
* Do you have a teachers PC or do you bring your own?
* Can you plug in a USB drive with spare material?
* Do the participants have computers in the room or do they bring their own?
* If there are machines in the room, are they identical?
* What operating system is installed?
* Is there a way for you to see a participants' screen?
* Is there a way to project a participants' screen to the entire class?
* Is it easy to put the computers away for a group discussion?
* Is there a risk of power outages?
* Is there an admin you can call for tech support?

----

## Software

Programming is only fun if you already have some programs:

* Is there a list of installed software or do you need to write one?
* Is there a centralized installation service? How much time in advance do they need?
* Do participants have root access to their machines?
* Can you test installation of everything in advance? *(if not, have a backup plan)*
* Have participants worked on the same computers before?
* Have participants used a text editor before?
* Is there a git repository for the course?
* Do participants know how to use git?
* Is there an admin you can call for tech support?
