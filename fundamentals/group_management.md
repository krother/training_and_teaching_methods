# Managing Groups

Teaching would be a lot easier if we could look into the students' heads and see what they need. When we ask them, we at best find what they are aware of. The art of teaching has a lot to do with finding out what your students need, and crafting lessons that are flexible enough to adjust to different audiences.

With one student, you will know what they need. With a group of six, you can adjust your lesson with very little effort.
With a group of fifteen finding out their needs is hard work, and above 25 you will have to generalize.
It also depends on their state of knowledge. If all participants have similar programming experience, adapting to them is a lot easier. Unfortunately, this is a rare case when you teach programming.
Your typical audience brings a broad mixture of expectations.

I had students bring babies, spouses and dogs to the classrooms. I had students going to weddings and coming from funerals.
I heard plenty of construction work and saw yoga groups pass through my classroom.
I had students who fell asleep, and students who brought cake and wanted to celebrate.
I had fire alarms and entire classrooms with a hangover. 
All of these situations are teachable, but you may want to find out who you are dealing with.
