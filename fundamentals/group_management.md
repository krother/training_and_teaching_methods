Teaching would be a lot easier if we could look into the students' heads and see what they need. When we ask them, we at best find what they are aware of. The art of teaching has a lot to do with finding out what your students need, and crafting lessons that are flexible enough to adjust to different audiences.
With one student, you will know what they need. With a group of six, you can adjust your lesson with a little effort. With a group of fifteen finding out their needs is hard work, and with 25 you will have to generalize.
It also depends on their state of knowledge. If all participants have similar programming experience, adapting to them is a lot easier. Unfortunately, this is a rare case when you teach programming.
Your typical audience brings a broad mixture of expectations.
