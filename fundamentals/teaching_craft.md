# Teaching is a Craft

You are going to conduct a programming course, tutorial or workshop.
I assume you know a thing or two about programming.
At least, you know more than your prospective students.
Since you have little time to prepare, you might do the following:

* *prepare a deck of slides*
* *take the slides into class*
* *see what you can cover in the time given*

Isn't that how everybody teaches?

Imagine you would apply a similar approach to programming:

* *write some code*
* *run it*
* *debug things on the fly*

You probably know that **developing software is a bit more than that!**
Programming is a craft.
There are practices like version control, testing and refactoring that produce clean, maintainable code.
These are established practices every professional developer uses.
Yet a beginner programmer is not aware they exist. 
A beginner programmer needs to learn the craft first.

With teaching it is the same.

**Teaching is a craft.**

## Who is this book for?

This book is an introduction to the craft of teaching programming.

It helps you to become a better programming teacher.
I wrote it to support junior teachers, part-time teachers and full-time teachers without a formal background in education.

It covers what to do before you enter the classroom, and how to do well in the classroom.
The book is divided into seven parts:

| part | what you can learn |
|------|--------------------|
| **Fundamentals** | what teaching is about |
| **Preparing Lessons** | what do do before you go into the classroom |
| **Warming Up** | how to master the beginning of a lesson or course |
| **Introducing New Content** | how to expose your class to new concepts |
| **Programming Exercises** | how to make your class apply the new concepts |
| **Wrapping Up** | how to finish a lesson |
| **Troubleshooting** | what to do if things take an unexpected turn |

The chapters covers time-tested techniques for teaching programming that I collected over the past 20 years.
You can use them as a guide to create a course from scratch or fish for ideas to spice up your classes.
