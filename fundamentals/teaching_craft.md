# Teaching is a Craft

When you are reading this book, I assume you are teaching a programming course, tutorial or workshop.
I also assume you know a thing or two about programming, at least more than your students.
How will you prepare for you prepare for your next teaching encounter?
One might do the following:

1. prepare slides with theory and code examples
2. present the slides in class
3. see what questions you can cover in the time given

Imagine you would apply the same approach to programming:

1. write code
2. run it
3. debug things on the fly

You probably know that **developing software is more than writing and running code!**
Programming is a craft.
The craft of programming includes practices such as version control, data modeling, testing and refactoring.
You need these practices in order to produce clean, maintainable code.
Every professional programmer needs to have such development practices under their belt.
However, a beginner programmer is not aware that a skill such as refactoring exists.
All the beginner sees is the code and the error messages.
This is why the beginner programmer needs to learn the craft first.

With teaching, it is the same.

## Who is this book for?

This book introduces you to the craft of teaching programming.
I wrote it for developers who teach occasionally and for full-time teachers without a formal background in education.
The book takes you on a tour of *teaching practices and skills*.
Some of these practices and skills make your lessons more engaging and fun.
Some others will be invisible to your students, but help them learn more effectively.
Or they make your work behind the scenes easier and give you time for other things.
All teaching practices in the book aim at helping you to become a better programming teacher.

The book is divided into seven parts:

| part | what you can learn |
|------|--------------------|
| **Fundamentals** | what teaching is about |
| **Preparing Lessons** | what do do before you go into the classroom |
| **Warming Up** | how to master the beginning of a lesson or course |
| **Introducing New Content** | how to expose your class to new concepts |
| **Programming Exercises** | how to make your class apply the new concepts |
| **Wrapping Up** | how to finish a lesson |
| **Troubleshooting** | what to do if things take an unexpected turn |

The chapters covers time-tested techniques for teaching programming that I collected over the past 20 years.
You can use them as a guide to create a course from scratch or fish for ideas to spice up your classes.
