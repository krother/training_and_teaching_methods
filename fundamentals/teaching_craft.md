# Teaching is a Craft

When you are reading this book, I assume you are teaching a programming course, tutorial or workshop.
I also assume you know a thing or two about programming, at least more than your students.
How will you prepare for you prepare for your next teaching encounter?
One might do the following:

1. prepare slides with theory and code examples
2. present the slides in class
3. see what questions you can cover in the time given

Imagine you would apply the same approach to programming:

1. write code
2. run it
3. debug things on the fly

You probably know that **developing software is more than writing and running code!**
Programming is a craft.
The craft of programming includes practices such as version control, data modeling, testing and refactoring.
You need these practices in order to produce clean, maintainable code.
Every professional programmer needs to have such development practices under their belt.
However, a beginner programmer is not aware that a skill such as refactoring exists.
All the beginner sees is the code and the error messages.
This is why the beginner programmer needs to learn the craft first.

With teaching, it is the same.

## Who is this book for?

This book introduces you to the craft of teaching programming.
I wrote it for developers who teach occasionally and for full-time teachers without a formal background in education.
This book takes you on a tour of *teaching practices and skills*.
You can use the book as a guide to create a course from scratch or fish for ideas to spice up your classes.

Some of the practices and skills make your lessons more engaging and fun.
Others will be invisible to your students, but help them learn.
Most of them make your work easier, so that you can focus on what matters â€“ your students.
All chapters cover time-tested techniques that I collected teaching coding, data science and many other subjects during the past 20 years.

I hope this book helps you become a great programming teacher.
