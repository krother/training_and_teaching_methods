# How to teach programming?

You are going to conduct a programming course, tutorial or workshop. Of course, you are good at programming. Since you have little time, you might do the following:

* *prepare lots of slides*
* *take the slides into class*
* *cover as much as possible in the time given*

Isn't that how everybody teaches?

Imagine you would apply the same approach to programming:

* *write as much code as possible*
* *get it running somehow*
* *debug things on the fly*

Of course you know that **the way of the software craftsperson does not look like this!**
Programming is a craft.
There are practices like version control, testing and refactoring that produce clean, maintainable code.

These are established practices every professional developer uses.
Yet a beginner programmer is not aware they exist.

With teaching it is the same.

**Teaching is a craft.**

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is an introduction to the craft of teaching programming.

It helps you to become a better programming teacher. I wrote it to support junior or part-time teachers without a formal background in education.
It covers what to do before you enter the classroom, what to do inside and what to do after your lesson ends.

The chapters covers time-tested techniques for teaching programming in an interesting way that I collected over the past 20 years.
You can use them as a guide to create a course from scratch or fish for ideas to spice up your classes.

## What do you need to get started?

To start teaching, you need humility, patience and love.

* **Humility**, because education is essential for a society. However, it will take years or decades for the full impact of good teaching to manifest. With rare exceptions, you will not see the fruit of your work (or be rewarded for them). Accept that or do something else.
* **Patience**, because you cannot force anyone to learn. It is the student who decides whether to learn or not. The only thing you can do is to propose something that looks interesting. And to try again and again if it didn't work.
* **Love**, because successful learning requires a healthy, mutually respectful teacher-student relationship. That also includes people who you don't necessarily like, or people you like but won't ever see again. Genuine love for humans helps a lot to not go crazy and get things done.

That is all you need, let's get started.
