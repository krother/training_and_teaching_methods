# Teaching Programming

**by Dr. Kristian Rother**

![](images/teaching.png)

You are going to conduct a programming course, tutorial or workshop. Of course, you know programming well enough, but do you know teaching as well? 

Isn't teaching something that some people *just do*? Since the clock is ticking, maybe you should not bother with didactics and *somehow get the course running*.

But wait – aren't you advocating *against* dirty hacks in programming most the time? Isn't there a craft beyond writing code: writing **clean code**, adhering to best practices, using software engineering techniques.

Teaching programming is a craft in its own right, and this document explains you how to do it.

This is a collection of time-tested techniques for teaching programming in an interesting way. I collected them during the past 18 years of teaching.

Whether you are preparing a new course from scratch or a lecturer looking for ideas to spice up your classes, this book might be useful for you.
