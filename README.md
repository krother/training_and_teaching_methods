# Teaching Programming

**by Dr. Kristian Rother**

![](images/teaching.png)

You are going to conduct a programming course, tutorial or workshop. Of course, you know programming well, but how about teaching? Isn't teaching something that you can *just do*? Since you have little time, maybe you should not bother with didactic theory and *somehow get the course running*.

But wait – aren't you arguing *against* quick and dirty hacks in programming all the time? Isn't there a craft beyond writing code: adhering to best practices, writing **clean code**, using the right tools and so on?

Teaching programming is a craft, too. It has its own set of tools. This document helps you to become a better programming teacher.
It contains time-tested techniques for teaching programming in an interesting way. I collected them during the past 18 years of teaching.

Whether you are preparing a new course from scratch or a lecturer looking for ideas to spice up your classes, this book might be useful for you.
