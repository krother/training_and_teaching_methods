Ask the group to suggest other keywords in a crossword-like manner.</p>

<p>The exercise is not to be taken too seriously. You don't need to enforce rules of normal corsswords meticulously. You also don't need to stick precisely to a grid when drawing characters.</p>

<p>As an extra incentive, you may add some bonus fields along the edges.</p>
