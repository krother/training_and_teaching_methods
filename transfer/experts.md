# Using expert knowledge

Many times, the teacher will not be the person who has all the knowledge. The moments when a participant turns out to be an expert in a particular matter are valuable, an opportunity worth seizing. Give them space to share their knowledge.

Sometimes the majority of your participants will know your subject better than you. These moments can be scary, and you might feel you are in the wrong place. But your role is still important as someone structuring the process – give them more space to share the experience, but keep in control of the process.

But most of the time, your experts will be participants who are just a day or an hour ahead of the others. Their first-hand experience is very valuable, because they can relate to beginners problems more easily than someone with years or decades of experience.

The methods below facilitate mutual sharing of experience.


## Fishbowl

The fishbowl is a classic facilitation method. Place the experts in the center and let them discuss a given topic. Place the other participants around them.
This is a great method for knowledge transfer from a more experienced to a  junior group.


## Business cases

Present a business case. with questions or roles

Collect examples of practical usage with your experts.


## Panel Discussion

An exchange with experts can be done as a moderated **panel discussion**.

### Step 1: Find 2-4 people for the discussion panel

Ask 2-4 experts to be available for questions. The others come up with questions. Ideally, the experts have a diverse background. Try to keep your panel well-balanced. Three experts representing *one option* and only one favoring *an alternative* are not a good idea.

### Step 2: Set a title for the entire session

Open questions are generally more encouraging, e.g. *"How to maintain a database?"*, *"What comes after machine learning?".* You can vizualize the title by projecting it on a screen or writing it on a board in big letters. Also the total time for the panel discussion should be known to everybody well in advance.

### Step 3: Prepare the room

The panel and chairperson should sit behind a table. Without the table the panel may feel exposed and uncomfortable. If the audience is larger, an elevated table is better. If the room is smaller, you may put name tags on the table.

### Step 4: Briefs the experts

Tell the panel in advance how you are going to start (e.g. by introducing everybody). Tell them what is the time limit for each answer (if any) and how you will remind them if they go over time. Ask them for questions. Be nice to them.

Give the audience time to prepare questions while you brief the panel. 

### Step 5: Open the panel

Announce the title, Welcome the experts and guests. Give the experts time to introduce themselves or state their expertise briefly.

### Step 6: Moderate the discussion

Your job will be to moderate the discussion. Keep it flowing, but restrain yourself to add any opinions or content, because that would make your experts look a bit stupid. Focus on creating a good mood instead.

Collect questions from the audience, rephrase them clearly, and pass them to 
the experts without further comment. Eventually, experts may want to take over questions from each other. 
In case the audience runs out of questions, you might want to pass a question through each panelist. Also have a few spare questions in stock.

### Step 7: Track time

Make sure that the discussion stays on the topic and prevent individual panelists from talking too much. If the panelists reach a hot or controversial topic you may decide to let the discussion flow for a while.

The total time of the discussion should not exceed 45'.

### Step 8: Close the meeting

Announce that the discussion is near the end. Give each panelist room for some closing remarks. Thank everybody for coming. Thank your panel – after all, it is them who made the discussion happen.


## Gemba

The Japanese term [Gemba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemba) refers to the real place where value is created. Seek that place: organize a field trip or, if possible, bring the experts workplace to your classroom (seeing a professional developers laptop setup might be an eye-opener for many).
