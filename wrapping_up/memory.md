### Comments

I have used Memory for repeating content at the beginning and end of a lesson. At the beginning, it makes a great warm-up exercise. The memory cards are easy to prepare on-the-fly, so that you can repeat what was done during a workshop at the end of the day.

It is easier to get this game started if you participate and flip the first pair.

The main advantage of Memory is that everybody gets to participate. Sometimes, participants feel encouraged to help each other, in which case you can lean back and watch comfortably.

It does not scale well to bigger groups though. 
Eight people is really the maximum.
