# Student Presentations

At the end of a course project, it is common practice to have students present their outcomes.
Giving participants room to present is generally a good idea.
But, especially with a bigger group, you want to avoid that part to become long and boring.
The **Lightning Talk** format is a refreshing alternative.

## Lightning Talks

Lightning Talks are a format seen on many conferences.
They promote short, refreshing, diverse talks.
To make the format work, establish a few ground rules:

### Time limit

Limiting time is the most important one. Use a strict limit of 5 minutes.
If possible, use a timer that the speaker sees all the time.
To enforce time, put 1-2 participants in charge of timekeeping and have them wave a flag or start clapping.

### Announce the talks early

Let your participants know early that they will be presenting and how. Also announce what you expect from presenters. Communicate the rules clearly, especially those on timing.

### Speaker sign-up

Put up a flipchart or board with the speaking slots, so that participants can sign up with their names/talk titles.
An online channel works as well.
If presenting is mandatory, use a random number generator to determine the speaking order.

### Any topic is fine

Encourage people to show code, live demos, notebooks, websites, diagrams or bugs.
Whatever interesting things they found on the way is worth sharing.

### Skip material

For a 5-minute talk you don't need to prepare a slide deck or handout.
One or two visuals are usually enough.
Good presentations are spoken freely.
