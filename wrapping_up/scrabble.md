## How it is done

* draw an empty Scrabble board.
* add a few bonus fields along the edges.
* write one keyword in the middle of the board.
* ask the group to suggest more words, add them in a crossword-like manner.

## Comments

Don't take this exercise too seriously. You don't need to enforce rules of normal corsswords meticulously. You don't need to stick precisely to a grid when drawing characters either.

As a variation, I also used giant scrabble tiles that made from cardboard.

## Variation: Boggle

| summary     | character soup |
|-------------|----------------|
| time        | 5' |
| preparation | 5' |
| group size  | 2-50 |
| material    | screen |

* create a random 5 x 5 matrix with characters
* give participants 3 minutes to write down as many words connected with the topic
* ask for the longest words

This exercise connects easily to lessons on strings or tables. You can make creating the random matrix a homework or in-class programming task. Look up the original **Scrabble** distribution of characters for your language on Wikipedia.
