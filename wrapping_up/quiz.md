## How it is done

* prepare 20 quiz questions from 4-5 categories
* place all questions on the board
* ask one participant to pick a category
* read the question aloud
* give your class time to think
* ask for volunteers to answer the question
* whoever answered a question gets to pick the next category

## Comments

This is a pleasant way to wrap up a week or entire course.
It leaves room for students to ask questions that they still might have.

If you want to make it a bit more competitive, divide the class into two teams.
You can experiment with jokers, timed challenges, sound effects etc.

## Variation: Bar Quiz

This is a more relaxed way to run a quiz.

Prepare a PDF with 10-15 quiz questions.
Each question has a **point value**.
It can include many types of questions:

* Multiple Choice
* Pair Puzzle
* One-word answers
* sort the lines / words
* Debugging
* Find a word matched by the given RegEx
* Trivia (identify the person in the picture)
* Estimates (how many lines of code did Guido van Rossum contribute to cPython?)

Divide the class into teams of 3-5 students. Give them 30-45 minutes to work on the tasks.
Depending on the difficulty, allow them to use the internet or not.
Have them hand their written answers to the next team to count points

Determine a winner.
