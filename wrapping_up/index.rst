Wrapping Up
===========

When your lesson nears the end, you may want to get students out of what they are doing
(hopefully writing code) to wrap up the lesson.
This section contains a couple of recipes that repeat and reinforce the new knowledge
and closes off the lesson cleanly â€“ so that everybody has a chance to recharge for the next one.
