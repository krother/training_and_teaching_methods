## Comments

Check & Cross helps to repeat if you have 10 minutes left at the end of your lesson. There is little that can go wrong. At worst, people start a discussion on their own. The best thing about this wrap-up technique is that you don't need to prepare anything in advance. This is why I keep this technique in my emergency kit all the time.

You can fine-tune this method by choosing easier or more difficult concepts. If the students differ much in their level of experience, add a few more concepts that they can choose from.
