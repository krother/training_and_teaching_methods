# More Recap Methods

Here are a few extra methods for repeating.

* True/False questions: make some statements, the group raises hands if they think it is true.
* teamquiz: two teams, 50% of the questions go to one team, 50% to both (whoever answers faster)
* interview questions, ask participants to answer one of them in a mini-speech
* prepare questions on cards; ask participants to move around, ask someone else a question, exchange cards and move on
* mind-mapping: place a central concept (or concept map) on the board; add other concepts around it together
* 2-minute-quiz: ask participants to write down a take home message and one open question at the end of the lesson
* Infographics:  Place cheat sheets / infographics in the room, so that participants see them all the time. You don't have to do anything else, just let the knowledge slowly trickle in.
* ask 3 participants to summarize the lesson in 60 seconds.
* leaning parcours: place 8-10 small + easy exercises in the room, let students move around and complete them
