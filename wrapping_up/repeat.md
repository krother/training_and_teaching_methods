Repeating key concepts in increasing intervals is crucial for learning success (the scientific term for this is *"spaced repetition"*). Thus, repeating is an essential teaching activity that should not be skipped. However, repeating may be difficult to prepare, because you and your participants may be tired at the end of a day/lesson, and repeating easily falls victim to any changes to your plan. Even if everything goes well, your participants may be very eager to code to the very last minute, and interrupting them would be a pity. General strategies to deal with repeating are:

* Point students to material for self-study – works, because most online training resources do a decent job at repeating.
* Start the next lesson with it – the repetition serves as a warm-up activity
* Keep it short – one well-planned activity at the end of a lesson may prompt

Here are a few extra methods for repeating.

* teamquiz: two teams, 50% of the questions go to one team, 50% to both (whoever answers faster)
* interview questions, ask participants to answer one of them in a mini-speech
* prepare questions on cards; ask participants to move around, ask someone else a question, exchange cards and move on
* mind-mapping: place a central concept (or concept map) on the board; add other concepts around it together
* 2-minute-quiz: ask participants to write down a take home message and one open question at the end of the lesson
* Infographics:  Place cheat sheets / infographics in the room, so that participants see them all the time. You don't have to do anything else, just let the knowledge slowly trickle in.
* ask 3 participants to summarize the lesson in 60 seconds.
* leaning parcours: place 8-10 small + easy exercises in the room, let students move around and complete them
