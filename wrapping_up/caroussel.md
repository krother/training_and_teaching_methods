### How it is done

* split the class in two equal groups
* arrange the groups in two concentric circles or rows facing each other
* ask one group to explain one concept to the other
* give them roughly 30 seconds
* shift positions by one, so that everybody sees a different face
* now it is the other groups turn to explain
* play 5-7 rounds

### Comments

If you have a very energetic group you can have them walk the circle or run around. See recording at the [Gulbenkian Training Programme in Bioinformatics](http://gtpb.igc.gulbenkian.pt/bicourses/)
