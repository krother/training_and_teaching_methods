# Feedback Methods

![guest book](../images/guestbook.jpg)

*Over 4 years, I brought a guest book to all my trainings to collect comments and autographs of participants. Originally, I wanted to squeeze some constructive feedback out of the participants. In the end, it turned out to be a – much nicer – collection of memories and drawings. But it's still feedback.*

## Why Feedback?

You might want to collect feedback after a lesson or course for various other reasons:

* find out what your participants learned
* make your participants aware of what they learned
* find out what to prepare for the next lesson
* improve a future edition of your course
* benchmark different courses against each other
* help participants to close the course mentally

In this chapter you find my favourite methods.

----

## Round Robin questions

1. Form a circle
2. Visualize 3 questions to ask (e.g. on a flipchart)
3. **Everybody** gets an opportunity to answer the questions.

### Sample questions:

* How will other people know that you have been in this course?
* What was fun for me?
* What was difficult for me?
* What did I find useful?
* I found it surprising that..
* I would like to learn more about..
* I was bored/frustrated when..
* I found interesting..
* I really liked..
* I am going to try..
* My wish for the the next day/session is..
* Something else I want to say..

## Collect Feedback with a Voting Box

![Voting Box](../images/closed_poll.png)

| summary     | collect cards with feedback in a box |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| time        | 10' |
| preparation | - |
| group size  | <30 |
| material    | paper cards, a mailbox, hat or box |

### How it is done

Write an open question on the board, e.g.:

*“What would you like to learn tomorrow?”*

Share small pieces of paper among the students. Give them some time to write down something and collect the paper pieces in the box. Evaluate the answers. If you are collecting feedback, start reading the answers only **after all students are out of sight**.

You can use this feedback technique to collect ideas and suggestions from a passive group. For instance, when your lessons start very late, when students have a lot of respect towards you, or when there is a language barrier. The method also helps if your group is heterogeneous or dominated by a few active trainees.

I often use this kind of poll for getting feedback after the first few days of a course, and prepare the rest of the course to the answers. It is a foolproof method that you can apply spontaneously.
It works much better than suggestive quesions like *"How do you like the course so far?"*.

In a longer course, you could keep the box around near the exit and check it regularly.

## Dot Voting

Which topics in a course should be revisited, repeated, or explained in more depth? **Dot Voting** lets large groups choose from up to 50 possible options within minutes.

![Dot Voting](../images/dot_voting.jpg)

| summary     | put sticky dots on topics |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| time        | 10' |
| preparation | 10' |
| group size  | up to 16000 (seen on the 34c3 conference) |
| material    | paper, lots of sticky dots |

### How to do it

1. Visualize all available topics on paper.
2. Explain the task, e.g. *“Stick dots on topics we should repeat tomorrow.”*
3. Distribute 3-5 sticky dots to each participant.
4. Students stick on their dots by themselves.

The dot voting procedure works with flipchart paper, cards on a pin board or even post-its. On a big pin wall, you can vote on 50 items simultaneously. You are not restricted to dot stickers. Magnets and even making crosses with pens works well.

Dot stickers make voting more interactive. The beauty of this method is that, in contrast to a poll with raising hands you give your participants time to think. Also there is a haptic component - you put responsibility literally into the hands of your participants.

Dot voting is frequently used on **Unconferences**, where it scales up to 100+ participants.

During the *RuPy conference*, I used poker chips to collect instant feedback on the talks.

## Feedback with Props

| summary     | put sticky dots on topics |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| time        | 10' |
| preparation | 10' |
| group size  | up to 16000 (seen on the 34c3 conference) |
| material    | paper, lots of sticky dots |

### How to do it?

1. Bring a set of different objects
2. Put all objects in a box or bag.
3. Prepare one question related to each object
4. One participant picks an object
5. Trainer asks the question
6. Two more people get the same object
7. Next object

### Example questions

| object | question |
|--------|----------|
| smiley | What was fun for you during the training? |
| heart  | What did you like about the training? |
| brain  | What are your thoughts right now? |
| globe  | Where can you apply what you learned outside? |
| spiky ball | What was inconvenient for you? |
| duck | What was your worst bug this week? |

## Fist or Five Feedback

![Fist or Five](../images/five.jpg)

| summary     | count the fingers |
|-------------|-------------------|
| time        | 5' |
| preparation | - |
| group size  | up to 20 |
| material    | - |

### How to do it?

1. After each training module, ask: *"How much did you learn during the lesson? Please show one to five fingers. Raise your hands!"*
2. Count how often each number of fingers occurred.
3. Keep track of the numbers

With this method, trainees feel more encouraged to provide critical feedback than if you would simply ask:

*"did you understand it or not?"*

The counting itself needs a bit of exercise to do it quickly. When using the Fist or Five technique for the first time in 2012 with a group of 20, we asked for each number from zero to five separately.

The main value of the Fist or Five technique is that it is easy to execute, it is quantitative, it is immediate and can be repeated many times during a course. I hope you will see lots of 'high fives' in your next course!

### Comments from participants:

*"It is a good feedback and it is immediate. Although I feel sometimes a little bit shy to express my opinion."*

*"I like it because it makes me think. It forces me to review and figure out whether I understood the subject or not and how much. It also shows you are interested."*

Also see: [voting procedure to reach consensus in group discussions](http://becomingtheboss.com/2012/10/17/fist-or-five-alternative-model-of-voting/).

*This method was explored in detail by Allegra Via, Kristian Rother and Pedro Fernandes.*

## Four-Corner Feedback

![Four-Corner-Feedback](../images/4corners.png)

| summary     | collect feedback on 4 questions |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| time        | 10' |
| preparation | 5' |
| group size  | up to 20 |
| material    | paper, multiple flipcharts, pens |

### How it is done

Hang 4 sheets of flipchart paper on different spots of the room. Write a question on each, e.g.:

* What did you like about the course?
* What should be improved?
* What would you like to learn more about?
* What will you use in practice?

Give markers to course participants and let them roam around and write for about 10 minutes. As a result, you obtain feedback on your course and your group has the opportunity to express things that may have been left unsaid.

### Comments

The four-corner method can be used for a number of purposes: Collecting information on a new topic, facilitating the transfer to everyday practice, or collectively looking for solutions to a problem.

## Marketplace

| summary     | participants exchange feedback informally |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| time        | 10' |
| preparation | 5' |
| group size  | 100+ |
| material    | many cards |

1. Each partipant notes 2-5 things on cards that they take as benefits out of the course.
2. Participants mingle, read one card to another person
3. If the other person agrees, he gets that card
4. Repeat

As a trainer, you might collect all cards in the end and evaluate.

## Start a Fire

| summary     | play with matches |
|-------------|-------------------|
| time        | 10' |
| preparation | 5' |
| group size  | 5 - 15 |
| material    | matches, water cup |

### How it is done

1. Ask *“What will you remember about the course?”*.
2. Pass around the cup and the matches.
3. Everybody may comment whatever they want, as long as the match is burning
4. There is one match per person, including yourself.

### Comments

* Check the location of smoke detectors, explosives, chemicals etc.
* Another person should hold the water cup in order to dispose the match quickly.
* Extend the time you speak by holding the match upwards.

## Supermarket

![Supermarket](../images/supermarket.png)

| summary     | quick feedback on the course contents |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| time        | 5-10' |
| preparation | 2' |
| group size  | 3 - 30 |
| material    | whiteboard or flipchart|

### How it is done

At the end of a course or day:

1. Draw a shopping basket and a freezer on the board
2. Place the board near the exit
3. Ask participants to write on the board what they find useful (basket) and what they don't need right now (freezer)

### Comments

If you are closing after this activity, you could ask participants to explain why they placed something in the basket or the freezer (small groups only).

Alternatively, participants might write their feedback on the way out.

The feedback you get is focused on the actual contents **and** its practical applicability. I find it a great way to filter out background noise, e.g. the atmosphere was nice etc.

----

## Target Feedback

1. Draw a target (concentric circles) with four quadrants
2. Label the quadrants "Atmosphere, Content, Method, Trainer, Usefulness, etc."
3. Hand out sticky dots to participants or pens
4. Partimants mark one dot per quadrant
5. Don't stare at the participants while they place their dots

## Traffic Light Feedback

*Collect quick feedback in a large group*

1. Every participant gets a red, yellow and green card
2. One participant formulates a statement regarding the course
3. Others indicate their level of agreement (green=full, yellow=partial, red=none)
4. Repeat
5. Stop before it gets dull (about 10 statements are sufficient).

## Online feedback tools

There is a plethora of online feedback tools. They are easy to evaluate, but less immediate than a questionnaire on paper. My favourites are:

* Typeform
* NBGrader (graded Jupyter notebooks)
* [Tweedback](http://twbk.de)
* [Socrative.com](http://socrative.com)

To prevent your survey landing in the trash bin allocate time before the end of the training to fill the form.

----

## Formative assessment

Develop formative assessments for the most important concepts:

* identify concepts to be tested
* identify misconceptions
* construct the assessment
* validate the test (with novices and experts)
* use the test

See: [Formative Assessment methods](https://www.edutopia.org/groups/assessment/250941)

## Other methods

Things I didn't write out in detail or haven't tried yet:

| technique | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Questionnaire | Share and collect a sheet with questions. Very formal but accurate feedback. Provides the best values when other trainers get the same questionnaire and you can compare results. |
| Review expectations | If you collected written expectations at the beginning of the course, review them together at the end |
| Fridge | Take a round answering a question *"What would you tell your (fridge/cat/kids) about the training day?"* |
| Free drawing | Place a sheet of flipchart paper on a table and ask participants to write or draw a summary of the course. |
| 1 Up, 1 Down | participants alternate positive and critical comments, without repetitions |
| Speedboat | every coach knows this one, google it |
| Headlines	| write a one-line news title on the question of the day |
| Postcards | pick a postcard that expresses your mood and explain why |
| Treasure box | collect hints for the follow-up course |
| Poll | Ask a series of binary questions |
| Hot or Not | ask about pairs of items: which is more important -> priorities |
