### How it is done

* write concepts from the last lesson on the cards
* create two cards more than there are participants
* share one card to each participant
* place the first card on the board
* anyone who can explain a connection from his card to an already attached one may place his card there
* continue until everybody has placed his card

### Comments

This activity has a self-balancing mechanism: The more cards are already there, the easier it will be to come up with an explanation. If someone gets really stuck, allow them to swap theirs for a spare card
