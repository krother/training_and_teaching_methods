## How it is done

* prepare a pile of words related to your lesson
* mix in a few concepts that are not programming concepts, but have something to do with your lesson
* one participant draws a card with a concept
* the others try to guess it by asking yes/no questions

## Comments

Once your participants figure out what kind of concepts the game contains, they usually build an efficient question hierarchy very quickly.

This lesson fits well to lessons on: tree data structures, decision trees, DOM objects etc.
