# Transfer Methods

Here are a few methods that help increase retention and practical aplication.

----

## Business Case

1. Draw a business problem on a flipchart (with a nice picture)
2. Write 5-6 questions on cards
3. Let pairs chat on one card each for 3-4 minutes
4. go through the questions together, discuss

----

## Question at beginning

Imagine the training was successful. What changes for you?

## Collect Pros and Cons from a Discussion

![Pros and Cons](../images/pro_con.png)

**Record the outcomes of a discussion.**

### Time in class
5-15'

### Group size
2-50

### What you need
whiteboard, flipchart, or a big sheet of paper

### How it is done

Write a concept or statement on top of the board. Divide the remainder into two columns labeled **pros/cons, advantages/disadvantages**, or simply **+/-**. You ask the group to provide input for each of the columns. You collect answers, write them down, and moderate the discussion.

### Examples

* Powerpoint makes presentations worse.
* You can write very fast programs in Python
* Python vs. Java
* Using Test-Driven-Development

### Comments

To work well, your group should be familiar with the topic already. You can connect to previous knowledge, or draw conclusions from something you did in your lesson. Alternatively, you can use the Pro-Con method to compare two technologies, two artists, two brands of coffee, or anything you like -just label the columns accordingly. This works perfectly, if your participants worked in two groups, each exploring one of the two contrasting aspects.

The Pro-Con approach helps to prevent a discussion drifting into random directions. This makes it a valuable tool in meetings or decision-making situations. In teaching, it is a good way to wrap up a lesson, because your group needs to recapitulate what they did before. Finally, when you run out of space on the board, it is the right time to end the discussion.

## Fishbowl with Experts

Many times, the teacher will not be the person who has all the knowledge. The moments when a participant turns out to be an expert in a particular matter are valuable, an opportunity worth seizing. Give them space to share their knowledge.

Sometimes the majority of your participants will know your subject better than you. These moments can be scary, and you might feel you are in the wrong place. But your role is still important as someone structuring the process â€“ give them more space to share the experience, but keep in control of the process.

But most of the time, your experts will be participants who are just a day or an hour ahead of the others. Their first-hand experience is very valuable, because they can relate to beginners problems more easily than someone with years or decades of experience.

The methods below facilitate mutual sharing of experience.

The **fishbowl** is a classic facilitation method. Place the experts in the center and let them discuss a given topic. Place the other participants around them.
This is a great method for knowledge transfer from a more experienced to a  junior group.
