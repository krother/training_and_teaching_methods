## How it is done

* create 3-5 multiple-choice questions
* give students 1-2 minutes per questions to answer them
* discuss answers with the group right away or in the next lesson

There are plenty of online tools to create MC-questions.
My favourite one to integrate into my own material is **[Quizdown](https://github.com/bonartm/quizdown-js) by Malte Bonart**.

## Comments

MC-questions scale up very well. Their main drawback is that it takes time to craft good questions.

I had a professor who consistently started his lecture at 8:15 with three MC-questions.
The audience was 500 medical students who had to answer lots of similar questions in exams.
He would have the questions on display during the first minutes (as the late students would trickle in). Then he would discuss the solutions to the questions from the previous day.
It was a very gentle wake-up and examn preparation at the same time.
