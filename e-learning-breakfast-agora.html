Only recently, education seems to have discovered the internet. Online courses are massively being created. The big universities like <a href=\"http://mitx.mit.edu/\">MITx</a> start joining the game. Clearly, learning is changing on a bigger scale.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For IT people, however, online university courses are only a manifestation of what we have been practicing for years. Learning a programming language from online content instead of a lecture seems to have been common practice almost forever. Admittedly, with services like <a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com\">Codeacademy</a> it is becoming nicer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is new, then? For instance, gamification is. Online tools like <a href=\"http://www.memrise.com/\">memrise</a> help learning vocabulary. <a href=\"http://fold.it/portal/\">Fold.it</a> implemented the 3D models of biomolecules as a game. <a href=\"http://www.socrative.com/\">Socrative</a> takes gamification on mobile devices and straight into the classroom.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What do these developments mean? How will the role of the teacher change? What e-learning tools are we yet to see? How does the future of analog teaching look like? What is there that online learning cannot achieve?</p>
