<p>Ask participants to write on the board what they</p>
<ul>
<li>find useful - these go to the basket</li>
<li>can't use right now - these go to the freezer</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask participants to explain why they placed something in the basket or the freezer (works with small groups only).

<p>As a result, you get feedback focused on the actual contents <b>and</b> its practical applicability. I find it a great way to filter out background noise, e.g. the atmosphere was nice etc.
</p>

<p>If you like, you can bring props into which participants drop notes with their suggestions, e.g. a basket (<i>and .. er.. a freezer</i>).</p>
