# How to get instant feedback from students?

![pingu asking for feedback](images/pingu.png)

## The Problem

You have **no idea** what is going on in your class.

![the wall of silence](images/wall_of_silence.png)

.. or worse, you **know** something is going on:

![teacher trying to talk to student](images/are_you_mad_at_me.png)

.. or everything is great and you would like to take a moment to **reflect** with your students:

## Solution

In online teaching, most students do not share useful feedback by themselves.
**Useful feedback** is information that lets you to fine-tune and improve the course as it runs.
Here, we are not too interested in feedback that allows you to compare courses, let alone teachers.

Below, you find four feedback strategies to choose from:

### A: Single/Multiple Choice Quiz

Ask three questions about subjects from the last lesson so that each student can have a guess:

![multiple choice quiz](images/feedback_multiple_choice.png)

There are many tools that allow you to create single-choice or multiple-choice quizzes.
Most **Learning Management Systems (LMS)** have a quiz app built in, Zoom has a **Poll app**,
and on Slack you have the [Polly app](https://scikitcilantro.slack.com/apps/A04E6JX41-polly?tab=more_info).

A low-tech version that works on most chat programs is to use Emoji responses. Here are True/False questions:

Quizzes like these are low-risk. 
They focus on the content and let you know how far the class is overall. 
Students can also assess their own progress.
In any case, they will want to hear the answer afterwards and may have follow-up questions.

Their main disadvantage is that you need to prepare the questions in advance.

### B: Collect ideas

A more spontaneous feedback is to collect ideas in an online app.
It usually makes sense that students can see the results – this builds mutual trust.
Here are three questions that are easy to start with:

![three questions](images/feedback_temp_check.png)

Collecting ideas on multiple questions allows you to mix information on technical aspects (*"which topic is difficult"*) or do an emotional **temperature check** (*"what do you like"*, *"what frustrates you"*).
You can use the temperature check question to release a bit of pressure in a controlled way.

Like with the quizzes, you can post your questions in a chat program and collect results there.
If you need a bit more freedom, a shared **Google Spreadsheet** is easy to set up.
A fancier (and free) tool is [the 3L activity on Funretrospectives.com](https://app.funretrospectives.com/?activity=3Ls).

### C: Prioritize ideas

If you want to gauge interests quickly or make a joint decision, you can let the group vote.
This is a great start for a wrap-up or recap session.

Technically, this works the same way as a quiz.
But the purpose is different – the voting empowers the students and makes it more likely they will talk.

### D: Lean Coffee

If you want to spend some time reflecting more deeply, you may want to try the Lean Coffee method.
It does not produce any tangible output, but allows you to cover many topics in a short time.
It works as follows:

![lean coffee method](images/lean_coffee.png)

The method needs some time (2 minutes for explaining, 5 minutes for collecting topics and voting plus 20-30 minutes for discussions).
It works with small to medium groups (up to 10 people).

The Lean Coffee method requires that people are in a constructive mode.
If you have conflicts boiling in the group, discussing them may make them worse.
The Lean coffee is a good way to run a retrospective at the end of a course unit or project.

### Warning: Feedback is confidential

Most feedback should be kept confidential unless everybody is comfortable sharing it.
It may be a good idea to destroy evidence after the course.
