# Managing Expectations

Meeting the expectations of your participants is one of your duties as a teacher. Meeting expectations could mean very diverse things: proceeding on a learning path, passing an exam, solving a business problem, not getting bored and many more.

If participants feel their expectations are not met, they get distracted easily, and it becomes more difficult to learn anything. On the other hand, expectations that are met, boost their motivation and makes their learning more productive. Thus, satisfying expectations makes your job easier and more rewarding.
In the long run, satisfying expectations helps you to get paid. Taken together, expectation management is a basic survival skill for a teacher.

In a programming course, learning about expectations also means learning about the existing skills of your participants. Programming is one of those topics where a few days experience make the difference between being overwhelmed and being bored. It is inevitable that you find out where the sweet spot of your participants is (and whether it is a broad or narrow distribution).

To meet expectations, they need to be managed a bit.
Expectation management was one of the most important things that I learned while teaching.
It takes asking participants for their expectations and a bit of sales skills. Here are a few very powerful techniques for both that allow you to manage expectations consciously.

## The Serpent

| summary     | Find out where your class is right now |
|-------------|-------------------|
| time        | 10' |
| preparation | - |
| group size  | 10-50 |
| material    | some space |

* ask your participants to sort themselves according to their programming experience
* point out where the levels are located in the room (on a 1-5 scale)
* give the group some time to sort
* ask some representative members to describe their experience, starting from the beginners
* ask 1-2 extra questions, e.g. what is their background and what they would like to learn 
* in the end, introduce yourself

If you have a big group, it may help to mark the scale in the room

## Message to the future

![Expectations](../images/expectations.jpg)

| summary     | Collect and review expectations of your participants |
|-------------|-------------------|
| time        | 5' |
| preparation | 5' |
| group size  | 5-30 |
| material    | paper cards / pens |

At the beginning of a course spanning multiple days, ask your participants to answer three questions, e.g:

* Why did you sign up for the course?
* What do you already know about programming?
* What would you like to learn during the course?

The participants write down their answers and read them aloud. Attach all cards with answers in the room. During the final session of the course, ask every participant to review and report on their expectations from the first day.

### Benefits for the teacher

You can adjust your course to the situation at hand. You can fine-tune your material. You don't need to spend sleepless nights creating new material: Focus on the parts participants ask for, give more room to Q & A or even kick out a topic completely. Explaining one straightforward example that students want to hear is much better than ten examples which they are not interested in.

### Benefits for participants

Asking participants at the very beginning shares responsibility. It also helps them to focus on what they need to learn. After all, they will be distracted by many things while programming.

When reviewing the expectations at the end of the course, participants will see what has changed for them. Their expectations will have time-traveled so that they can compare with their former *self* from the past. Discovering how you have developed during a few days is very powerful. Participants commented when reviewing expectations:

* *"I am not afraid any more."*
* *"I learned a lot."*
* *"Asking us for our point of view shows you care"*

Collecting and reviewing expectations sets a clear frame for your entire course. The expectations establish a double feedback loop. You can improve your course, and your students will see what has improved for them.

## 4 Expectation questions

| summary     | Collect diverse statements from the group |
|-------------|-------------------|
| time        | 15' |
| preparation | 10' |
| group size  | 5-30 |
| material    | 4 big sheets of paper |

Write four questions on four sheets of paper:

* What would like to be able to after the course?
* What are you hoping for?
* What are you concerned of?
* What would you like to do?

Let participants circle the room, write their answers on the sheets and look at each others answers. A short follow-up discussion helps to clarify points.

## 4-Mat: Selling your lesson in one minute

![4MAT](../images/4mat.svg)

People have 4 preferences how they would like to consume knowledge. Taking all four into account in the order:

* Why should I pay attention?
* What is the lesson about?
* How will the lesson take place?
* What interesting things can I expect?

A one-minute technique for expectation management is to answer each of the four questions briefly. This way, you address the needs of all participants. Planning for the answers help you to construct an interesting lesson.

*4-Mat is a method attributed to Bernice McCarthy, 1979*

## Selling your lesson in 7 minutes

Sometimes, participants need to be convinced that they are in the right place (especially, if they did not volunteer to be there). A more detailed explanation in the beginning could cover the following points:

### 1. Utility

show value (personal, job, organization)

### 2. Product

show a goal for the training

### 3. Process

describe your approach to training

### 4. Objectives:

* activity (not ability): *"at the end of this module you will show/demonstrate/explain/draw/build X."*
* requirements: *"volunteering, time, randomize, all/some"*
* expected degree
* benchmark/method

### 5. Justification:

Source of your information

### 6. Build credibility:

Provide evidence of previous success of the subject/method/yourself

### 7. Review:

emphasize critical points softly, restate utility.

## Early Victory Strategy

Let your trainees know they are on the right track at the very beginning.

Start with something short & easy. Do a small interactive exercise at
the very beginning that you are 100% sure of that all trainees are able
to solve. The purpose of this is to build self-confidence towards the
exercises that follow. It also mentally warms up the group.

This can be used to introduce a new topic, but also to repeat some
content from the previous lesson.

**Example:** Completing an almost complete program and executing it.

*Source: The early victory strategy is based on the teaching of Sun Tzu.*
