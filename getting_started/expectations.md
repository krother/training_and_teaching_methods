# Managing Expectations

Meeting the expectations of your participants is one of your duties as a teacher. Most of the time it matches progress on their learning path. Also, meeting expectations helps to get paid.

Satisfying expectations most of the time was one of the most important things that I learned while teaching. If a participant feels his expectations are not met, that is immensely distracting for him, and it becomes more difficult to learn anything else.

To meet expectations, they need to be managed a bit. It takes asking participants for their expectations and a bit of sales skills. There are a few very powerful techniques for both:

## Message from the past

**Collect and review expectations of your participants**

At the beginning of a course spanning multiple days, ask your participants to answer three questions, e.g:

* Why did you sign up for the course?
* What do you already know about programming?
* What would you like to learn during the course?

The participants write down their answers and read them aloud. Attach all cards with answers in the room. During the final session of the course, ask every participant to review and report on their expectations from the first day.

Collecting and reviewing has two benefits:

### For the teacher

You can adjust your course to the expectations. You can fine-tune your material. You don't need to spend sleepless nights creating new material: Focus on the parts participants ask for, give more room to Q&A or even kick out a topic completely. Explaining one straightforward example that students want to hear is much better than ten examples which they are not interested in.

### For the participants

Asking participants at the very beginning shares the responsibility. It also helps them to focus on what they need to learn. After all, they will be distracted by many things while programming.

When reviewing the expectations at the end of the course, participants will see what has changed for them. Their expectations will have time-traveled so that they can compare with their former *self* from the past. Discovering how you have developed during a few days is very powerful. Participants commented when reviewing expectations:

* *"I am not afraid any more."*
* *"I learned a lot."*
* *"Asking us for our point of view shows you care"*

Collecting and reviewing expectations sets a clear frame for your entire course. The expectations establish a double feedback loop. You can improve your course, and your students will see what has improved for them.

### Hint
A side effect of this method is that you can become familiar with the group


## 4 Expectation questions

Here are four questions that require a bit more thinking about the answer. The results are best written down.

* What would like to be able to after the course?
* What are you hoping for?
* What are you concerned of?
* What would you like to do?


## 4-Mat: Selling your lesson in one minute

People have 4 preferences how they would like to consume knowledge. Taking all four into account in the order:

* Why should I pay attention?
* What is the lesson about?
* How will the lesson take place?
* What interesting things can I expect?

A one-minute technique for expectation management is to answer each of the four questions briefly. This way, you address the needs of all participants. Planning for the answers help you to construct an interesting lesson.

*4-Mat is a method attributed to Bernice McCarthy, 1979*

## Selling your lesson in 7 minutes

Sometimes, participants need to be convinced that they are in the right place (especially, if they did not volunteer to be there).

You could cover the following points in the beginning:

### 1. Utility

show value (personal, job, organization)

### 2. Product

show a goal for the training

### 3. Process

describe your approach to training

### 4. Objectives:

* activity (not ability): *"at the end of this module you will show/demonstrate/explain/draw/build X."*
* requirements: *"volunteering, time, randomize, all/some"*
* expected degree
* benchmark/method

### 5. Justification:

Source of your information

### 6. Build credibility:

Provide evidence

### 7. Review:

emphasize critical points softly, restate utility.

## Early Victory Strategy

Let your trainees know they are on the right track at the very beginning.

Start with something short & easy. Do a small interactive exercise at
the very beginning that you are 100% sure of that all trainees are able
to solve. The purpose of this is to build self-confidence towards the
exercises that follow. It also mentally warms up the group.

This can be used to introduce a new topic, but also to repeat some
content from the previous lesson.

**Example:** A single associative exercise or completing an almost complete program work well.
