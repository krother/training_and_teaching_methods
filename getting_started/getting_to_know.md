# Getting to know each other

Most participants appreciate when you address them by their name. Knowing each other has many benefits: It creates a good atmosphere, it gives you information early to fine-tune your lessons (e.g. their expertise), and gently shifts the group into the right mindset for learning.
But this puts you in a difficult spot: Your participants usually outnumber you, and memorizing all the names is hard work.

----

## Should you learn the names or not?

You have four options how to deal with the names of your participants:

1. *Don't care about names.* Do this when your audience numbers more than 30 people and you won't see them for longer than a day.
2. *Provide name tags.* Do this, if the group is less than 30 people and it will take time to memorize them.
3. *Do an introduction activity.* Do this if the group size is 15 or lower.

The introductions should be short to avoid the impression that you are wasting time playing games. As a rule of thumb, use the table below.

| setting | duration |
|---------|----------|
| one-time lecture | - |
| half-day training | <5 minutes |
| one-day training  | <15 minutes |
| one-week course   | 30 minutes |
| longer course     | up to 1 hour, possibly split to multiple sessions |

In this chapter, you find several methods to get to know your group.

## Name tags

![Name Tag](../images/name_tag.svg)

| summary     | participants create their own name tags |
|-------------|-------------------|
| time        | 5' |
| preparation | 5' |
| group size  | 5-30 |
| material    | paper cards / pens |

* A7 cards folded in the middle make great name tags
* share the material for the cards before, it creates a good start as people arrive
* give participants proper pens, otherwise you won't be able to read the names
* collect the tags at the end and distribute them in the next lesson(s) - until you know the names
* post-its work as an alternative to the cards

## Introduction with items

![Items](../images/items.svg)

| summary     | participants explain very easy concepts |
|-------------|-------------------|
| time        | 10' |
| preparation | 20' |
| group size  | 5-20 |
| material    | items or cards |

* create cards representing programs, instructions, databases or other concepts relevant to your course
* pick concepts that participants are already familiar with
* leave some empty space
* share the cards to participants and ask them to write their names on them
* everybody says who they are and how they relate to their card.
* attach the cards to the board.

### Hints:

* If the group has more than 10 people, let them work in pairs.
* Be 100% sure that they really know what is on the cards, otherwise it will be very embarassing for them.
* This method benefits from an open room setup.

### Example:

In the beginning of a bioinformatics course, I used about 10 cardboard molecules: tRNA, ribosomal subunits, mRNA, ATP. While introducing themselves, the students explained and as a side effect repeated the molecules that we worked on in the course - they were primed during the introduction.

## Introduction Memory

![Introduction Memory](../images/intro_memory.svg)

| summary     | learn to know each other |
|-------------|-------------------|
| time        | 10' |
| preparation | 20' |
| group size  | 5-10 |
| material    | cards in two colors |

* create cards with names of all participants + trainer
* write cards with 6-8 questions (favourite food, comes from, reason to be here etc.)
* turn one person card and a question card
* the person drawn answers the question and draws next
* play 10-20 rounds

----

## Three things

| summary     | participants establish common ground |
|-------------|-------------------|
| time        | 10' |
| preparation | 0' |
| group size  | 4-100 |
| material    | - |

* form pairs
* ask participants to to find three things they have in common
* let them talk for 3 minutes
* each pair briefly reports what they found

In a big group, it is enough to ask participants to talk to their neighbors and ask for a few reports from different people.

----

## Ball chain

| summary     | participants repeat names |
|-------------|-------------------|
| time        | 10' |
| preparation | 0' |
| group size  | 6-20 |
| material    | - |

![](../images/intro_ball.svg)

* Form a circle
* throw a ball to each other and say from `<MY_NAME>` to `<YOUR_NAME>`
* repeat until every participant had the ball 1-2 times

This method is good for a *second* introduction round, e.g. on a second day, when participants already know each other a little.

----

## Guess who I am

| summary     | participants guess things about each other |
|-------------|-------------------|
| time        | 10' |
| preparation | 0' |
| group size  | 5-15 |
| material    | small paper cards |

* share the cards
* ask everybody to write down something about themselves, e.g. *"I have 2 cats"*
* collect the cards, shuffle them and read each statement aloud
* the participants guess who it is.

This is a good method if the group members already know each other â€“ it does not make much sense otherwise. You need to formulate the task very clearly.

I used this game in starting a programming course in a *first contact* situation. It was my first course in English, and it was their first course in English. We were quite nervous at first, but the guessing helped to break the ice.

## Skill matrix

| summary     | participants assess their own expertise |
|-------------|-------------------|
| time        | 15' |
| preparation | 10' |
| group size  | 4-12 |
| material    | board or spreadsheet |

Participants and teachers rate their expertise in 5 areas on a scale of 1-5, e.g.:

* Python programming
* data visualization
* math + statistics
* databases
* Machine Learning

Collect the numbers on the board or an electronic table.

This is a versatile method that produces data that helps you to assess the situation. You can repeat the exercise at the end of the course (to measure progress), or use the table right afterwards (as part of a programming exercise on data structures, databases, plotting etc.).

## When participants know each other well

* introduce yourself
* collecting expectations is super important here
* distrust your first impression
* keep the introductions short
* have participants introduce each other
* let participants ask questions about you

----

## Other methods

* write 3 introduction questions on flipchart.
* ask pairs to interview each other and then introduce their team partners
* *"museum"*: ask participants to place one item from their bag on a tray and introduce them with it
* short pantomimic introduction of a hobby or something they did recently (works if the group already knows each other)
* participants introduce themselves briefly, but insert one lie. The others guess what was wrong (if the group knows each other, good primer for a lesson on conditionals)
* divide the participants into smaller groups, each group introduces itself by drawing a poster (quicker way to introduce a big group)
