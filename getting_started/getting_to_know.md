# Getting to know each other

You and your participants knowing each other has many benefits: It creates a good atmosphere, it gives you information early to fine-tune your lessons (e.g. their expertise), and gently shifts the group into the right mindset for learning.

## Names

Most participants appreciate when you address them by their name. Knowing each other a little goes a long way in creating a climate good for learning. But this puts you in a difficult spot: Your participants usually outnumber you.

Now, you have four options how to deal with that fact:

1. *Don't care about names.* This is the right thing to do when your audience numbers more than 30 people and you won't see them for longer than a day.
2. *Provide name tags.* Do this, if the group is less than 30 people and it will take time to memorize them.
3. *Do an introduction activity.* Do this if the group size is 15 or lower.

The introductions should be short to avoid the impression that you are wasting time playing games. As a rule of thumb, use the table below.

| setting | duration |
|---------|----------|
| one-time lecture | - |
| half-day training | <5 minutes |
| one-day training  | <15 minutes |
| one-week course   | 30 minutes |
| longer course     | 1 hour or more |

Below, you find several methods to get to know your group.

## Name tags

Provide each participant with material to create a name tag.

Hints:

* A7 cards folded in the middle make great name tags
* give participants proper pens, otherwise you won't see the names
* collect the tags at the end and distribute them in the next lesson(s) - until you know the names
* post-its work as an alternative to the cards

## Introduction with items

### Time

15 minutes

### Group size

5-20

### Material:

cards representing programming instructions, databases, algorithms or other prerequisites of your course.

### Description:

Create cards that have an easy concept important for the course on the front, and some empty space. Share the cards to participants and ask them to write their names on them. Then one by one explains who they are and what the item is.

Attach the cards to the board.

### Hint:

If the group has more than 10 people, let them work in pairs. Be 100% sure that they really know what is on the cards, otherwise it will be very embarassing for them. Eventually, you can print a short description
on the back side.

This method benefits from an open room setup.

### Example:

In the beginning of a bioinformatics course, I used about 10 cardboard molecules: tRNA, ribosomal subunits, mRNA, ATP. While introducing themselves, the students explained and thereby repeated the molecules that we worked on in the course.

## Introduction Memory

* cards with names of all participants + trainer
* 6-8 questions (favourite food, comes from, reason to be here etc.)
* take turns unveiling one person and a question

## Three things

* form pairs
* find 3 things you have in common
* each pair reports what they found

## Ball chain

Form a circle and throw a ball to each other and say from <MY_NAME> to <YOUR_NAME>

## Guess who I am

### Time in class
10'

### Group size
5-15

### What you need
small paper cards

### How it is done
Share the cards. Ask everybody to write down something about themselves, e.g. *"I have 2 cats"*
Collect the cards, shuffle them and read each statement aloud. Have the participants guess who it is.

### Comments

This is a good method if the group members already know where everybody knows each other - it does not make much sense otherwise. You need to formulate the task very clearly.

I used this game in starting a programming course in a *first contact* situation. It was my first course in English, and it was their first course in English. We were quite nervous at first, but the guessing helped to break the ice.

## Skill matrix

Participants and teachers rate their expertise in 5 areas on a scale of 1-5, e.g.:

* Python programming
* Data visualization
* math + statistics
* databases
* Machine Learning

Collect the numbers on the board or an electronic table.

This is a versatile method that produces data that helps you to assess the situation. You can repeat the exercise at the end of the course (to measure progress), or use the table right afterwards (as part of a programming exercise on data structures, databases, plotting etc.).

## Other methods

* write 3 introduction questions on flipchart.
* ask pairs to interview each other and then introduce their team partners
* play the *"name ball"* game to repeat names
* *"museum"*: ask participants to place one item from their bag on a tray and introduce them with it
* short pantomimic introduction of a hobby or something they did recently (works if the group already knows each other)
* participants introduce themselves briefly, but insert one lie. The others guess what was wrong (if the group knows each other, good primer for a lesson on conditionals)
* divide the participants into smaller groups, each group introduces itself by drawing a poster (quicker way to introduce a big group)


## How to deal with participants that know each other well

* introduce yourself
* collecting expectations is super important here
* distrust your first impression
* keep the introductions short
* have participants introduce each other 
* let them ask questions about you
