Upside-Down
===========

================ =======================
summary          incite lateral thinking
================ =======================
time             5’
preparation time 1’
group size       all
material         board or nothing
================ =======================

How it is done
--------------

Write a question on the board that asks for the opposite of what you
want to teach. Let the students digest the question for 1-2 minutes and
let them discuss. Then ask, and write their suggestions on the board.
Add from your own notes afterwards.

Examples
--------

-  "How could you write a really bad program?"
-  "How could you create a very bad plot?"
-  "How could a program waste a lot of memory?"
-  "Give examples of inefficient data structures."

.. hint::

   The only disadvantage of the Upside-Down method is that you cannot use it too frequently in the same course.
   But having an inverted question on different topics every now and then is fine.
