## How it is done

Solve a small programming problem with 5-10 lines. Provide participants with comments but no code:

    :::python3
    # 1. activate the plotting library
    ...
    # 2. create numbers from 1-20 (x)
    ...
    # 3. create squares of the numbers (y)
    ...
    # 4. plot both x and y
    ...
    # 5. save the plot to a file
    ...

Give the students the task.
Let them work in pairs.
Ask them to indicate when they are done.

Let them show (or tell) their solutions.

## Comments

The task should be **very easy** for most students.
I often overestimated their capabilities and we ended up having very long explanations.

The solutions give you a good impression what the group is comfortable with.
