# Priming

**Priming** is a central aspect of warm-up techniques. It is a neuropsychological concept that can be expressed as: *"directing the attention of people to a particular field."* Priming helps your participants understanding a concept, because they will start looking in the right area of their brain. Priming reaches out to related concepts, so you can make heavy use of all kinds of metaphors and analogies. The brain will copy and adapt these concepts, which is much faster than rewriting them.

What does that mean in practice? It means that instead of using the first warm-up method that you come across, prime your participants towards the *concept* that follows right afterwards.

Priming can be achieved by a rich variety of activities: questions, quizzes, practical examples, short videos, cartoons and many more.

## Example:

You want to prime participants for a lesson on debugging.

1. Display a short recipe for baking a pizza
2. Ask participants what mistakes someone executing the recipe might make
3. Ask what the consequences of these mistakes would be
4. Collect everything in a table

Most likely, your participants will come up with different types of bugs:

| bug | consequence |
|-----|-------------|
| forgot yeast | dough will be ruined |
| too much peperoni | too hot but can be fixed plucking them off |
| baked too short | pizza not tasty, can be fixed by baking again |
| baked too long | pizza is burned |

While introducing debugging concepts (e.g. a defect and its effect appear in different places or bugs in development vs. deployment), you can refer to the pizza examples as they fit.
Also, you can expect participants to be more active because the priming already put them in the *"debugging mode"*.

See the **Warming Up** chapters for more methods that can be used for priming.
