Theater
=======

An exciting warmup activity is to have a short theater play about
programming.

Below you find the script for a 5’ play.

-  print 3 copies of the script (:download:`DataTypesHaveDinner.pdf`)
-  give them 5’ to prepare themeselves
-  make room on the stage and get out of the way

The play fits best to start a lesson after the students have heard about
the three data types.

Data Types have Dinner
----------------------

**Task: act out the dinner by reading from the script.**

Action
~~~~~~

*List preparing dinner. String comes home.*

S: Hi List!

L: Hi String!

S: (agitated) You know what? I had a terrible day at work!

L: What happened?

S: I had Unicode issues all day long. I have been telling my users they
should use proper Unicode characters ever since Python 3.0. And still
they get the encoding wrong.

L: Is the encoding really that important? I wouldn’t care too much.

S: Yes I know, “everything is an object”. You keep iterating that.

L: OK I admit I am not looking too closely at my contents like you do.
But dict is doing the same.

S: Oh, there they are.

*Dict comes in*

D: Hi folks! You know what! I had a terrible day at work!

S+L: What happened?

D: The same user came back again and again. It was get values, get
values all day long.

S: What’s so bad about that? Nobody can look up things as quickly as you
do.

D: Yes, but if you want my values in a certain order, you end up
checking all of them. This is really a lot of work.

L: Send them to me next time. I can keep my stuff sorted.

D: *(slightly annoyed)*

S: So how was your day, List?

L: Terrible day as well? Imagine, someone wanted to index me with a
string!

D: *(grinning)*

S: No way. That’s embarrassing! I hope you gave them a an IndexError.

L: A big one! Just to make sure they use an integer index next time.

D: *(still grinning and nodding)*

L: And what are you grinning about?

D: I don’t see why you can’t put a string in your square brackets.
Strings work fine as keys with me.

L: Really? Hey String, how would you feel being one of their keys?

S: I don’t mind as long as I’m unique.

*(List and String do a high-five)*

*(doorbell rings)*

S: Hey it’s a delivery! We got new data.

D: Who is it for?

S: I’m immutable, so it has to be one of you.

L: I could just append it to myself.

D: Check if there’s a key.

S: Yes, there is one. Here you go.

D: And now let’s eat.
