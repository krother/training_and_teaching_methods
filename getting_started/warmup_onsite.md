## Algorithmic games

**Boost motivation before the theory.**

Invent a paper version of an algorithm that you need to explain. Write
down the instructions as pseudocode. Give out items representing
the data, so that the trainees will be able to ”execute” the program.

In most cases, even a simplified representation allows experiments on
execution time, order of exercution etc.

### Example: Tree Traversal

An exercise for a tree traversal algorithm. At least seven students
arrange themselves as a binary tree (because they have only two arms to
point at each other). Requires a ball or small object, which the trainer
gives to the root node when everybody knows the instructions. You can
give numbers or pseudonyms to the nodes (works better than the real
names for some reason).

    Pseudocode:

    1. If you get the ball from behind:
       - call your name.
       - give the ball to the person at your left arm.

    2. If you get the ball from your left:
       - give it to the person at your right arm.

    3. If you get the ball from your right:
       - give it to the person behind you.

## Brainstorming with cards

| Where | course |
|-------|--------|
| time  | 10'    |
| preparation time  | 5'    |
| group size | 2-25 |
| material | board, pens, 1-3 cards per student |

### How it is done

Ask an open question on your topic, e.g. *"What programming languages do you know?"*. Write the question on the board or use a prepared slide. Share the moderation cards to pairs of students. Give them up to five minutes to collect their thoughts. Then collect the cards, read them aloud, and attach them on the board. If you get duplicates, put them up as well (to avoid trashing someones input). You can ask a volunteer to help you with the attaching.

At the beginning of a lesson, this method is a powerful opener, because it connects to existing knowledge. You can use it in a follow-up lesson to repeat content or start something new by connecting to everyday experience. Just make sure your question triggers more than one answer.

### Comments

The extra effort with the cards is justified only if you use the resulting cards during your lesson. Possible continuations are to cluster the cards on the board, explore a few of them deeper, or add a new conceptual layer to them. For instance, if your new topic in the above example were "lesson planning" you could connect the above example to a new topic with the question *"In what parts of a lesson are the methods applicable?"* The cards can be nicely sorted into categories of the new topic.

Collecting cards is a basic, very formidable facilitation method. You can also use it to find about your students' expectations or simply to introduce everybody. Handling the cards is not completely straightforward, there are small pitfalls such as getting your students to write readable. As a moderator, you can write the cards yourselves, but to activate your class it is better if they get moving.
