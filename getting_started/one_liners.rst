How it is done
--------------

Create 5 small programming problems that can each be solved by a single line.
Provide participants with comments but no code:

.. code:: python

   # 1. activate the plotting library
   ...
   # 2. create numbers from 1-20 (x)
   ...
   # 3. create squares of the numbers (y)
   ...
   # 4. plot both x and y
   ...
   # 5. save the plot to a file
   ...

Give the students the task. Let them work in pairs. 
Ask them to indicate when they are done.

Let them show (or tell) their solutions.

Comments
--------

The tasks should be **very easy** for most students.
I often overestimated their capabilities and we ended up having very long explanations.

The solutions give you a good impression what the group is comfortable with.

This type of exercise goes together well with an online platform for interactive coding such 
as `binder <https://mybinder.org/>`__, `gitpod <https://www.gitpod.io/>`__ or `JupyterLite <https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/>`__.
