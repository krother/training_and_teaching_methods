# Warming Up

Warming up is very important in a programming course, because it protects your participants from frustration.
The goal is give your participants a feeling of achievement at the very beginning.
Every participant must be able to complete your warm-up activities **easily**.
If you have to think whether an activity might be too challenging, it is too difficult.

Warming up can have a couple of functions:

* **Priming** them for a new topic. I believe this is the most important one.
* repeat concepts from a previous lesson
* make them familiar with exam questions
* help the class to know each other and grow into a team
* make time for students to arrive before you start the main content

Warming up should be short. Make sure you get to the main part after 10-20 minutes.

Below, you find methods I have used for warming up. Most methods contain an interactive component, because programming is a team sport.

----

## Start with why

A crucial part in adult learning is to make clear *why* a concept, command or tool is useful. Start with the problem. You could even create a table with different problems and fill in solutions together. For example:

| problem | bad solution | tool |
|---------|--------------|------|
| keep old versions | copy files | git |
| keep code working | test manually | pytest |
| readable code | custom standards | pylint |

----

## Upside-Down

*Incite lateral thinking in your group.*

| Where | course |
|-------|--------|
| time  | 10'    |
| preparation time  | 1'    |
| group size | all |
| material | board or nothing |

### How to do it

Write a question on the board that asks for the opposite of what you want to teach. Let the students digest the question for 1-2 minutes and let them discuss. Then ask, and write their suggestions on the board. Add from your own notes afterwards.

### Examples

* “How can I write a really bad program?”
* “How can I waste memory?”
* “Name inefficient data structures.”

----

## Code with mistakes

1. Display a piece of code with three bugs
2. Give participants time to find them.

----

## Story

Tell or read an instructive story. These can be your own stories, or general programming wisdom (sources: Master Foo, the Tao of Programming, *"Stone Soup"* from the "Pragmatic Programmer" etc).

----

## Storytelling

Ask participants to tell a story from their own experience.
It does not have to be a technical one.

**Example:**

To introduce a bicycle project, ask:

    :::text
    Please tell a bicycle story.


----

## Open question

Start with an open question and give people 2' to think. Collect a few answers.

**Example question:**

    :::text
    Why would you want to use a database?

----

## Yes/no questions

Involve the group by raising hands on the options or present the questions through an online tool.

----

## Show a video

Show a brief video for priming. See the according chapter in **Lectures**.

----

## Cartoons

Show a cartoon.
Ask the participants to explain it or ask what it has to do with topic X.

Good sources of material are:

* [xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com/)
* [phdcomics.com](http://phdcomics.com)
* [classicprogrammerpaintings.com](https://classicprogrammerpaintings.com/)

----

## Puzzle

e.g. matching pairs of concepts and examples.

----

## Match headlines
Provide a text, let students assign headlines to paragraphs. Here they have to read, and the text may keep them busy for quite a while.

----

## Find captions

1. Display an uncommented code example
2. Present 1-3 questions about the code
3. Let participants talk about it for 5 minutes in small groups.

----

## One-liners

Solve a small programming problem with 5-10 lines. Provide participants with comments but no code:

    :::text
    # 1. activate the plotting library
    ...
    # 2. create numbers from 1-20 (x)
    ...
    # 3. create squares of the numbers (y)
    ...
    # 4. plot both x and y
    ...
    # 5. save the plot to a file
    ...

----

# Teaser Gallery

1. Display multiple images (up to 20) in the classroom or in an online medium.
2. Ask each participant to pick an image and explain why they picked it.

Besides warming up the group, you may receive some information about their background or experience.
The activity is very much open ended and mainly makes the participants feel welcome.

**Example:**

At the beginning of a Machine Learning course, you could show images like:

* a line plot
* a self-driving car
* a rainbow flag
* a robot
* a person with an anti-ai-camo mask
* Andrew Ng
* Ada Lovelace
* the Fibonacci spiral
