# Warming Up

Warming up is very important in a programming course, because it protects your participants from frustration. The goal is give your participants a feeling of achievement at the very beginning. All warmup techniques have in common that every participant must be able to do them successfully.

Below, you find methods I have used for warming up. Most methods contain an interactive component, because programming is a team sport.

Warm-up could take place while introducing a new topic, or to repeat content from the previous lesson.

## Priming

**Priming** is a central aspect of warm-up techniques. It is a neuropsychological concept that can be expressed as: *"directing the attention of people to a particular field."* Priming helps your participants understanding a concept, because they will start looking in the right area of their brain. Priming reaches out to related concepts, so you can make heavy use of all kinds of metaphors and analogies. The brain will copy and adapt these concepts, which is much faster than rewriting them.

**Priming is the brain equivalent to Ctrl-C + Ctrl-V from StackOverflow.**

What does that mean in practice? It means that instead of using the first warm-up method that you come across, prime your participants towards the *concept* that follows right afterwards.

Priming can be achieved by a rich variety of activities, so if you have a idea that is easy for your participants, it is probably a good one.

### Example

To prime participants for a lesson on *associative arrays/dictionaries/database indexes*, you could ask: *"how do you look up something in a dictionary?"*.

To prime a lesson on debugging, you could display a recipe for baking a pizza. Then ask participants to invent ways how to break the recipe.

## Algorithmic games

**Boost motivation before the theory.**

Invent a paper version of an algorithm that you need to explain. Write
down the instructions as pseudocode. Give out items representing
the data, so that the trainees will be able to ”execute” the program.

In most cases, even a simplified representation allows experiments on
execution time, order of exercution etc.

## Example: tree traversal

An exercise for a tree traversal algorithm. At least seven students
arrange themselves as a binary tree (because they have only two arms to
point at each other). Requires a ball or small object, which the trainer
gives to the root node when everybody knows the instructions. You can
give numbers or pseudonyms to the nodes (works better than the real
names for some reason).

### Instructions:

* If you get the ball from behind, call your name. Then give the ball to the person at your left arm.
* If you get the ball from your left, give it to the person at your right arm.
* If you get the ball from your right, give it to the person behind you.


## Upside-Down

*Incite lateral thinking in your group.*

| Where | course |
|-------|--------|
| time  | 10'    |
| phase | start  |
| group size | all |
| material | board or nothing |

### How to do it

Write a question on the board that asks for the opposite of what you want to teach. Let the students digest the question for 1-2 minutes and let them discuss. Then ask, and write their suggestions on the board. Add from your own notes afterwards.

### Examples

* “How can I write a really bad program?”
* “How can I waste memory?”
* “Name inefficient data structures.”

## Brainstorming with cards

### Time in class
10'

### Preparation time
5'

### Group size
2-25

### What you need

* thick pens
* moderation cards (1-3 per student)
* a place to put up the cards. A big pin board and pins work best, but a whiteboard plus painters' tape will do as well.

### How it is done

Ask an open question on your topic, e.g. *"What teaching methods do you know?"*. Write the question on the board or use a prepared slide. Share the moderation cards to pairs of students. Give them up to five minutes to collect their thoughts. Then collect the cards, read them aloud, and attach them on the board. If you get duplicates, put them up as well (to avoid trashing someones input). You can ask a volunteer to help you with the attaching.

At the beginning of a lesson, this method is a powerful opener, because it connects to existing knowledge. You can use it in a follow-up lesson to repeat content or start something new by connecting to everyday experience. Just make sure your question triggers more than one answer.

### Comments

The extra effort with the cards is justified only if you use the resulting cards during your lesson. Possible continuations are to cluster the cards on the board, explore a few of them deeper, or add a new conceptual layer to them. For instance, if your new topic in the above example were "lesson planning" you could connect the above example to a new topic with the question *"In what parts of a lesson are the methods applicable?"* The cards can be nicely sorted into categories of the new topic.

Collecting cards is a basic, very formidable moderation method. You can also use it to find about your students' expectations or simply to introduce everybody. Handling the cards is not completely straightforward, there are small pitfalls such as getting your students to write readable. As a moderator, you can write the cards yourselves, but to activate your class it is better if they get moving.

## Other warmup methods

### Code example
Show a code example and have participants talk about it.

### Code with mistakes
Show a piece of code in which three mistakes are to be found.

### Story
Tell or read an instructive story. These can be your own stories, or general programming wisdom (sources: Master Foo, the Tao of Programming, *"Stone Soup"* from the "Pragmatic Programmer" etc).

### Open question
Start with an open question and give people time to think.

### Yes/no questions
Involve the group by raising hands on the options.

### Show a video
Show a brief video for priming. See the according chapter in **Lectures**.

### Repeat content from the last lesson
All methods from the chapter **Repeating** apply.
