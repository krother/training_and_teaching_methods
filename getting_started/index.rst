Warming Up
==========

Suppose you want to deliver a lesson on **time series forecasting**.
You have the lesson fully worked out with theory and exercises.
As an example you want to use bicycle rental data (check out `Bike Sharing
Demand on Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand>`__ ).

At the beginning of a lesson you want to achieve multiple things:

Get the full attention of your students
---------------------------------------

Build authority and rapport
---------------------------

Make them talk about the subject
--------------------------------

… on top of that, you don’t want to spend too much time warming up your
class. After the first 10 minutes you want to get to more serious stuff.

In the following chapters we will look at a few things you could do in the beginning.
