How it is done
--------------

-  take a piece of code from the previous day
-  introduce a 3-5 bugs
-  in class, run the code and see it fail
-  ask students to explain what is going on
-  ask students to fix the code
-  repeat until you fixed all the bugs

Variation
---------

Alternatively, assign students to groups of three and give them a working program.
Let each of them introduce a bug that the other ones have to fix.
Play three rounds.

.. note::

   This is trickier, because the IDE may spoiler what lines have changed or where the bug is.
