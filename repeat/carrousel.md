# Repeating in a carrousel

**dynamic method for repeating**

### Time in class

5 minutes

### Group size

10-30

### What you need

space for people to move

### How it is done

You split the class in two groups. Both form two concentric circles or
two rows facing each other if there is less space. Instruct one group to
explain one concept to the other, give them roughly 30 seconds. Then
shift positions so that everybody sees a different face. Now it is the
other groups' turn to explain. After 5-8 rounds, your group will be well
activated.

You can put a lot of energy into the movement, see our performance at the
