Example Lesson: Create Tables in SQL
====================================

**An example lesson featuring cute penguins**

--------------

In this chapter, I want to describe an entire lesson, bringing together all elements of from the previous chapters.
As a topic, I chose the SQL ``CREATE TABLE`` statement, because I believe all of you will understand the content.
In the following, I want to explain the parts of the lesson and why it is designed the way it is.

You find a classroom-ready description of the lesson in :download:`penguin_lesson.zip`.

--------------

Goal
----

**Participants load a CSV file with penguin data into a SQL database.**

Explanation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Loading the CSV file is a single, specific goal that a teacher or the
students can check easily. Although this goal is self-sufficient, it can
be used in the context of a bigger project. For instance, you could
follow up with a lesson on ``SQL SELECT`` that uses the penguin table.

--------------

Prerequisites
-------------

Participants need to have **PostgreSQL** installed and have access via
``psql``.

.. _explanation-1:

Explanation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This prerequisite is important because the installation is a potential
time sink. I decided for ``psql`` because it works on all operating
systems. The ``psql`` tool could be replaced by a different tool
(e.g. pgadmin4 or an ORM), reusing some of the material.

--------------

Concept Map
-----------

.. _explanation-2:

Explanation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The concept map contains six key concepts and describes their semantic
relationships. The number of six stay one below the recommended maximum
of seven. I did not want to add any extra concepts, because the purpose
of the lesson is to introduce the SQL ``CREATE TABLE`` as such, not to
cover all its details.

I used Greg Wilsons very logical concept map style, because I wanted to
try it. I created a sketch on paper first. Then I drew the concept map
using Inkscape. Note that the concept map does not cover any **syntax**
or **enumeration** of e.g. data types.

I treat this concept map as the backbone of the lesson. One could
develop several lessons on the same topic from it, use it to recap or
improvise on top of it. Knowing SQL well, I feel ready to go into the
classroom with the concept map alone if I have to. But I prefer to have
some more material so that the students can *do* something.

*The next sections prepare the lesson better and make it a lot easier to
teach.*

Lesson Plan

========== ============= =====================================================
time (min) phase         description
========== ============= =====================================================
0          warm-up       say hello and announce title of the lesson
2          warm-up       ask students to name a few penguins they know
10         warm-up       show the CSV file, introduce the problem/goal
15         new content   show and execute the CREATE TABLE code example
35         new content   show the concept map
40         BREAK         -
50         apply content students load the bigger penguin file in pairs
70         wrap-up       discuss common problems you found during the exercise
85         wrap-up       show the concept map again
========== ============= =====================================================

.. _explanation-3:

Explanation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a complete plan for a 90â€™ lesson, leaving some buffer. If you
are new to teaching, you might want to have it near while you are
teaching.

I wrote the lesson plan **after** developing the code example and
exercise you find below.

-  the penguin naming activity in the warm-up section is for **priming**
   the class on the penguin topic. I want to have a short, fun conversation
   about penguins so that the class feels comfortable with the topic.
   Essentially I am building up the punchline **"and in this CSV you have another 300 penguins!"**
-  the goal can be introduced with any medium (whiteboard, Slack or
   other), but it should be visible all the time.
-  the order of the two parts in **new content** is interchangeable. I
   would start by showing the code and asking the class what they think
   it does to establish a dialogue. I might give them a few minutes to
   discuss that among each other first. Then we would take the code
   apart together. But in a larger or stressed audience starting from
   the concept map might be a safer strategy.
-  in the apply section I would expect the need to support the students
   because they might not know how to start ``psql``, where to find the
   data, forget semicolons etc.
-  the repeating of the concept map could be replaced by some more
   active recap method easily.

Material
--------

-  image with 3 penguin species (:download:`penguin_heads.png`)
-  example SQL CREATE TABLE statement (:download:`penguins.sql`)
-  concept map (:download:`concept_map.png`)
-  CSV file with small penguin dataset (50 rows, 5 columns) (:download:`penguins.csv`)
-  Excel file with small penguin dataset (:download:`penguins.xlsx`)
-  CSV file with big penguin dataset (:download:`penguins_big.csv`)
-  PDF with exercises (:download:`exercises.pdf`)
-  Faded examples (:download:`faded_examples.sql`)

.. _explanation-4:

Explanation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A material list is very useful for checking whether your material is complete.

--------------

Code Example
------------

.. code:: sql
   
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS penguins (

       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    
       species TEXT,
       gender VARCHAR(10),
       bill_length_mm NUMERIC NOT NULL,
       body_mass_g INT CHECK (body_mass_g >= 0 AND body_mass_g < 10000)

   );

.. _explanation-5:

Explanation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The point of this code example is to cover the basic structure of a
``CREATE TABLE`` statement. With the expection of ``COPY`` it contains at
least one example of each item from the concept map.

The difficulty can be adjusted by adding or removing data type and/or
constraints. If you have more time, you might want to iterate over the
``CREATE TABLE`` statement over multiple lessons, adding something new
each time.

--------------

.. include:: exercises.rst

.. _explanation-6:

Explanation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the exercises you need to make the exercises and data files
available to the students via a repository or LMS.

The exercises are designed to require some teacher support if the
students are new to SQL.
Exercises 1-4 are easy and show a minimal path for creating a table.
Exercise 5 is more difficult. A strong student might complete exercises 1.-4. quickly on their own and then be up for a challenge.
Having a mix of easy and difficult exercises helps you to balance a heterogeneous class (which is frequent).
Make sure to communicate that you do not expect everybody to finish everything.

--------------

Backup Plans
------------

-  use some of the extra exercises in :download:`faded_examples.sql`
-  if participants are unfamiliar with relational databases, open the
   CSV file in a spreadsheet application and discuss problems with data consistency

.. _explanation-7:

Explanation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Estimating the time for activities correctly is difficult.
Having an extra exercise you can add may help you to feel more comfortable.

Examining the data in a spreadsheet is a fallback plan if it turns out that
you grossly overestimated the abilities of your class.
This is a good type of plan B if it is your first lesson with a class.

If you are more experienced, you might change plans on the fly.
I do not write down my backup plans very frequently, but usually I have them.
If things go well I will trigger a backup plan without any of the students noticing.
