# Group Puzzle

This is a more advanced social form that allows you to cover **a lot** of content.
Here is how it works:

----

### Preparations

You need:

* a moderately complex task that requires combining multiple topics (e.g. "modify the colors in a photograph")
* 3-4 topics (e.g. *"RGB colors", "modifying Numpy arrays", "reading and writing images", "image formats")
* some reading material for each topic (1-2 pages, an example script etc.)

Ideally, the task is open-ended and tolerates some creative tinkering.

----

### Part 1: Task Teams

* Assign people to teams of (3-4) people
* All teams get the same task (a more complex one)
* Let them chat for 5' to clarify the task
* Do a short Q & A
* Announce the topics and ask each group to assign at least one person to each topic.

----

### Part 2: Topic Teams

Now comes the puzzle aspect. The teams regroup:

* the people for each topic get together
* they work on the material and work on a **simple** task (e.g. "read the text and create RGB colors for the rainbow")
* let them work on the task for a while (30' at least)
* be ready to troubleshoot

The trick is that every student now carries a lot of responsibility for their own team.
At the same time, they are never alone!

----

### Part 3: Coming back

Finally, everybody goes back to their original team:

* everybody summarizes what they learned to their teammates
* start solving the task
* give them plenty of time for that

Following the idea 'the best teacher is someone who just learned himself.' Course trainers orchestrated the process.
