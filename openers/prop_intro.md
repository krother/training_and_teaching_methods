# Introduction with items

*learn to know the group and warm up some content already.*

### Time

15 minutes

### Group size

5-20

### Material:

cards representing molecules, programming instructions, deadly diseases or whatever is the topic of your course.

### Description:

Create cards that have a concept important for the course on the front,
and some empty space. Share the cards to students, have them write down
their names on them. Then one by one explains who they are and what the item is.

Attach the cards to the board.

### Hint:

If the group has more than 10 people, let them work in pairs. Be 100%
sure that they really know what is on the cards, otherwise it will be
very embarassing for them. Eventually, you can print a short description
on the back side.

This method benefits from an open room setup.

### Example:

In the beginning of the 2005 Molecular Modeling course, I used ~10
cardboard molecules: tRNA, ribosomal subunits, mRNA, ATP. While
introducing themselves, the students explained and thereby repeated the
essential basics.
