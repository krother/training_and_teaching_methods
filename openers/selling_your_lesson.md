# Selling your lesson

Sometimes, participants need to be convinced that they are in the right place
(especially, if they did not volunteer to be there).

You could cover the following points in the beginning:

### 1. Utility

show value (personal, job, organization) 

### 2. Product

show a goal for the training

### 3. Process

describe your approach to training 

### 4. Objectives: 

* activity (not ability): *"at the end of this module you will show/demonstrate/explain/draw/build X."*
* requirements: *"volunteering, time, randomize, all/some"*
* expected degree
* benchmark/method

### 5. Justification:

Source of your information

### 6. Proof of ability:

Provide evidence 

### 7. Review:

emphasize critical points softly, restate utility.
