# Videos in training sessions

**inspired by Pedro Fernandes**

Pedro examined showing video clips to prime a group at the beginning of a training session. Since then, I have been using videos in several training scenarios. In this article, you find three scenarios described.

## 1. Videos to motivate

At the beginning of a two-day Biopython programming course for 15
people, I showed a [video on sickle-cell anemia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4-c3hUhhyc). The
4:00 video clip explained the molecular basis of the disease from DNA to
protein to symptoms in a patient. The main task on the first day was to
develop an experimental test for the disease. All programming exercises
related to sickle-cell anemia (retrieving and analysing protein and DNA
sequences, for example). 

Showing the video established a common ground
for all participants. The participants were given the same background
knowledge, and connecting the exercises to a concrete disease gave them
a purpose. As a result, the video helped the entire course to move into
one direction.

## 2. Videos to reinforce knowledge

During a two-day course on the Scrum methodology for 20 people, we watched the
video [“Sh\*\*t bad Scrum Masters say”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGbsgs611MM) by Adam Weisbart. The 4:00 video clip shows a series of exaggerated mistakes of a
team facilitator. The course participants already had experience as a
Scrum team, and had learned basic facts during the training. The
participants were given the task to note what was wrong prior to showing
the video. After watching the clip, the group reported their notes,
which the trainer compared to a prepared list. A few extra questions
were clarified in a brief discussion. Effectively the participants not
only applied their knowledge, but by observing a (staged) team they
could reflect on their own style of work.

## 3. Videos to guide a discussion

At the beginning of a 90-minute meeting of a peer support group, we watched the
first six minutes of the video [“The Cloud”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVoz_pEeV8I) by Uri Alon were
shown. In the video recording of a TED talk, Uri explains a
model how scientists get stuck and unstuck again. The group
subsequently discussed for one hour about “the crisis of meaning” in
science. The purpose of showing the video was to prevent the discussion
from drifting into a series of complaints. Showing the video achieved
three things: First, it provided a model and vocabulary by which the
group could express their own situation more precisely. Second, it
established a positive tone from the beginning by stating that crises
are normal events that can be resolved. Third, it set a boundary what
the discussion would be about.

## Conclusions

In all three scenarios, I found two technical issues essential: The
first issue was downloading the video from Youtube to a local file in
order circumvent the risk of network failure (there are multiple tools
available although many of them are linked to advertisement). The second
issue was providing an appropriate sound quality. For the typical course
audience a set of small speakers should be sufficient, but laptop
speakers clearly are not. Taken together, I found showing short videos a versatile method to spice
up a training.
