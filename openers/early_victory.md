# Early Victory Strategy

Let your trainees know they are on the right track at the very beginning.

Start with something short & easy. Do a small interactive exercise at
the very beginning that you are 100% sure of that all trainees are able
to solve. The purpose of this is to build self-confidence towards the
exercises that follow. It also mentally warms up the group.

This can be used to introduce a new topic, but also to repeat some
content from the previous lesson.

**Example:** A single associative exercise or completing an almost complete program work well.
