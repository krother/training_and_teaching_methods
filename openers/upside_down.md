### How to do it

Write a question on the board that asks for the opposite of what you want to teach. Let the students digest the question for 1-2 minutes and let them discuss. Then ask, and write their suggestions on the board. Add from your own notes afterwards.

### Examples

In a programming course:

* “How can I write a really bad program?”
* “How can I waste memory?”
* “Name inefficient data structures.”

In a teaching course:

* "How can I prepare the worst lesson possible?"
