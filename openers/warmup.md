# Warm-up methods

The general strategy for warming up is to let your trainees know they
are doing well at the very beginning. To achieve that, start with
something short & easy. Do a small interactive exercise at the very
beginning that you are 100% sure of that all trainees are able to solve.
This builds self-confidence towards the exercises that follow. You can
warm-up while introducing a new topic, but also to repeat some content
from the previous lesson.

### Say hello
Always greet your class (it is very awkward if forgotten, so even after years I write this into my lesson plans)

### Title
Always show and announce the title of your teaching unit.

### Overview
Providing an overview of the topics to come. Just keep it short. Nobody wants to see the whole syllabus at the start.

### Stories with mistakes
Tell or read a story in which three mistakes are to be found.

### Open question
Start with an open question and give people time to think.

### Yes/no questions
Involve the group by raising hands on the options.

### Upside down
Ask a question for the opposite (e.g. “How to make the worst possible seminar?”). Makes students think and suggests better ways to do it.
