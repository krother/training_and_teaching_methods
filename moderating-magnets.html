<h1>Moderating with Magnets</h1>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><img alt="" src="images/magnets.png" width="600" align="none"></span><br><div style="text-align: justify;"><p>When moderating an interactive teaching session, a huge <span style="font-weight: bold;">pin board</span> is the visualization tool that I dream of. However, most classrooms don't have one. Period. Do you need to resign from sophisticated moderation methods, then?</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Fortunately, all whiteboards, many blackboards, and the back sides of a flipchart contain solid iron. Thus, you can use <span style="font-weight: bold;">magnets</span> to attach material you would otherwise use pins for. You can do useful things with magnets: Attach <span style="font-weight: bold;">prepared pictures</span> on-the-fly or things created during the session (e.g. <a target="_blank" title="" href="/posts/recipe-collect-cards-open-your-lesson">collecting cards</a>). The magnets let you <span style="font-weight: bold;">move around stuff</span>, so you can cluster items, highlight key points, or create a live visualization. Most of all, you don't end up in the sticky tape hell when you have magnets at hand.</p>However, there are some pitfalls to avoid:<br><ul><li>Get good, strong magnets of 3-4 cm diameter (see <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.modulor.de">Modulor</a>). Weak magnets ruin your day.</li><li>Before your session, align the magnets on the side of the board. This avoids that you play with them in your hands.</li><li>Never, ever pull a magnet across the surface of a whiteboard. The damage is more severe than a permanent marker.</li><li>Keep the magnets separate from your electronic equipment, especially your laptops hard disk.</li><li>Don't mix colors, they confuse. Just simple black or white. However, I keep a single big red magnet to highlight things on the board - e.g. the current point of an agenda.<br></li></ul>With these things in mind, magnets are a useful little helper that make your day at the board a pleasant one. I got hooked to the electrifying power right before a magnet attaches. Have you tried it already?<br>
