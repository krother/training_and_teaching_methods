# Notes for Trainers

### Theme
The content of the course is wrapped into a *Moby Dick* theme: trainees will count frequent words in Melville's book about the white whale. The theme is the driving force that will motivate trainees to keep going.

### The Challenges
Challenges are problem descriptions relevant to the topic of the course. They are related to real-world problems. Challenges are more general than e.g. tasks for trainees. You can adjust challenges to fit to a given difficulty or time frame. They are the raw material to create both *tasks* and *learning objectives*.

### The Tools
Tools are what your trainees will use to solve the challenges. They include: Python programs, code examples, example data etc. Tools are interchangeable. The material given here works with different Python testing frameworks.


# Presenting an academic topic

## Option Z: cover lots of points
**Boooring**, because
* brain is not wired to remember long lists
* lack of drama

## Alternative 1: Only 3 points
## Alternative 2: find one example that represents all points
## Alternative 3: map, very strong structure, introduce a hierarchy that the audience can experience themselves, or even build. Showing a mind map is *not* satisfactory.
