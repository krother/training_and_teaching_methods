
Preparing a programming course

Rother, Fernandes, Via

CENTRAL MESSAGE:
plan a programming course like a language course

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
- programming is complex

OUR APPROACH
- taken approach of a language course
- many interactive methods used
- examples etc based on book
- tested in IGC 2010-2013 in 5-day course with 16-20 participants/year

MODULAR STRUCTURE
- four sessions per day (1.5h, 1h, 2h, 1.5h)
- 3-4 topics per day, between one and two slots (1h-3.5h length).
- each module with learning goals announced. 
- each module with small warm-up at beginning (exercise to repeat or question etc).
- each module with a theoretical part (major at beginning, diminishing towards the end)
- each module with practical exercise (smaller and bigger programming tasks)
- each module at the end with finger feedback (see below).
- follows 'sandwich' structure documented by Pedro

STRUCTURING THE CONTENT
- 9 categories: reserved words, data types, control flow, built-in functions, methods, program structure, modules, Linux, other
- cards pinned up in the back wall of the room (6 sqare meters of pin board)
- presence of cards reminded students what they already had (for instance when stuck during an exercise
- students felt their own progress
- cards were used for repeating on day 4: students asked to explain something from previous day
- cards were used for voting at end of day 2 which subjects need further attention
- 'at the beginning felt like we were toddlers but was really useful later' (Vreede).
- repeating round where each students asks another a question about cards in the back.

INTERACTION
- code puzzle
- shared folder
- shuffling pairs of participants several times during the course
- Hands up feedback - fist or fingers
- index graph
- table data types

GIVING AWAY RESPONSIBILITY
- day 2 started with 4 imprompty presentations of 1 minute each.
- early in the course: lots of theory, strict planning
- middle, shortening the presentation part, partially to as little as a single drawing on the whiteboard.
- group puzzle: covering 4 different subjects [PUZZLE FIGURE]: alignments, imaging, plots, R. Each group got a few example scripts, an exercise to implement, and a PDF as a reference. Worked independently with small pieces of advice. Then came back to the original group and explained what they had learned to their colleagues. Following the idea 'the best teacher is someone who just learned himself.' Course trainers orchestrated the process.
- day 5/I: giving them 13 short scripts, asking each one to explain one of them
- day 5/II: project
- BLAST: step-by-step tutorial
- final round of repeating: giving them a program, letting them 
- search image
- count C's
- exercise graphs
- sort activator
- caroussel repeat

FEEDBACK
- expectations collected at the very beginning, reviewed at the very end.
- fist or five [PHOTOGRAPH]
- sticky dots
- brainstorming on day 2 for which topics should be covered on day 4/5
- open questions written down at the end (closed poll)
- questionnaire

RESULTS:
- questionnaire
- testimonials 
- comments after one year (Pedro?)
