# Using Poker Chips

1. Evaluate conference talks by putting up boxes labeled
:-D :-| :-( and a pile of chips.
2. Assign Story Points to User Story cards – as an alternative to Planning Poker.
3. Estimate business value in a team – similar to the above.
4. Choose the top 3 out of 10 alternatives in a meeting
by throwing chips on a roulette table-like drawing.
5. Have newbie programmers simulate an algorithm when teaching them (e.g. tree traversal).
6. Randomly pick a “volunteer” from your team (put n-1 green chips and 1 red one into a bag, draw).
7. Put them in a plastic box and make some noise – more useful than you think.
8. Play poker!
