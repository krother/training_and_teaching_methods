# Collect Pros and Cons from a Discussion

![Pros and Cons](images/pro_con.png)

**Record the outcomes of a discussion.**

### Time in class
5-15'

### Preparation time
none

### Group size
2-50

### What you need
whiteboard, flipchart, or a big sheet of paper

### How it is done

Write a concept or statement on top of the board. Divide the remainder into two columns labeled **pros/cons, advantages/disadvantages**, or simply **+/-**. You ask the group to provide input for each of the columns. You collect answers, write them down, and moderate the discussion.

### Examples

* Powerpoint makes presentations worse.
* You can write very fast programs in Python
* Python vs. Java
* Using Test-Driven-Development

### Comments

To work well, your group should be familiar with the topic already. You can connect to previous knowledge, or draw conclusions from something you did in your lesson. Alternatively, you can use the Pro-Con method to compare two technologies, two artists, two brands of coffee, or anything you like -just label the columns accordingly. This works perfectly, if your participants worked in two groups, each exploring one of the two contrasting aspects.

The Pro-Con approach helps to prevent a discussion drifting into random directions. This makes it a valuable tool in meetings or decision-making situations. In teaching, it is a good way to wrap up a lesson, because your group needs to recapitulate what they did before. Finally, when you run out of space on the board, it is the right time to end the discussion.
