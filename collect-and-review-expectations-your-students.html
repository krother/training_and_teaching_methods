<h1>Collect and review Expectations of Your Students</h1>

<p>At the beginning of a five-day programming course, we asked our students to answer three questions:</p>

<ol><li><p>What is your background?</p></li><li><p>What do you need the course for?</p></li><li><p>What would you like to achieve?</p></li></ol><p>The students wrote down their answers and read them aloud. We attached all cards with answers in the back of the room. During the final session of the course, we asked every student to review and report on their expectations from the first day.</p><div class="media"><img class="media-object" src="images/expectations.jpg"></div><p>Asking students for their expectations has twofold benefits:</p><h4>For the teacher</h4><p>First, you can adjust your course to the expectations. You can fine-tuning your material.You don't need to spend sleepless nights creating new material: Give more room to Q &amp; A where required, reallocate your time budget, include methods that require little or no preparation, or even kick out a topic completely. Explaining one straightforward example that students want to hear is much better than ten examples in which they are not interested in.</p><h4>For your students</h4><p>Second, when reviewing the expectations at the end of the course, Students will see what has changed for them. Their expectations will have time-traveled so that they can compare with themselves from the past. Discovering that you have developed during a few days is a powerful message. Students commented when reviewing expectations:</p>

<ul><li><p><i>"I am not afraid any more."</i></p></li><li><p><i>"I learned a lot."</i></p></li><li><p><i>"Asking us for our point of view shows you care"</i></p></li></ul><p>Collecting and reviewing expectations sets a clear frame for your entire course. The expectations establish a double feedback loop. You can improve your course, and your students will see what has improved for them.</p>
