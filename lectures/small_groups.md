Methods for small groups
------------------------

Some methods that work well with groups of 5-15 people

### Group work
Create small groups (2-4 people). Hand out a text or other material. Give a task assignment, e.g. explaing out the method or the main message in the group and presenting it briefly.

### Poster gallery
Students prepare posters (drawn on big sheets of paper), the posters are hung on the walls and stay visible as a result.

### Work sheets
Good for calculating, writing short definitions, drawing.

### Fix learning goals
Summarize goals at the beginning

### Puzzle
e.g. identification of molecules from structural formulas, with or without options given.

### Controversial statement
Say something obviously wrong (slowly, suggestively, and make a loong break), or controversial (e.g. “to make a good seminar, you need many PowerPoint slides”) to start a heated discussion.

### Match headlines
Provide a text, let students assign headlines to paragraphs. Here they have to read, and the text may keep them busy for quite a while.

### Quiz
Ask concrete questions related to the subject. As a small competition it works well for repeating.

### Find captions
Provide a graph without a title. Let students find a title and interpret the meaning of the diagram. e.g. “What is the main effect?”

### Contrast pictures
Show two pictures showing different concepts (e.g. healthy/disease). Ask students to compare them & describe the differences.

### Finding pairs
Show two lists of concepts A and B, and let students find out which of them belong together.

### Recall
Let students discuss a question with their neighbor, then collect results.

### Brainstorming
Ask an open question (not a yes/no one). Collect ideas or expectations on the board. Works well at the beginning. You can also do a brainstorming after a PPT presentation to see what students have already learned.

### Challenge question
Make your audience think by asking a challenging question .

### Observe students
Check the reactions of students during a seminar. If they do not answer a question, this gives you a lot of information about how they feel.

### Animations
Videos or animated PowerPoint slides have a much stronger impact than just a picture. 

### Treasure Box
You can use an object or visual representation of the results of the students work. Seeing what they accomplished motivates them.

### Catchy title
Use a title that expresses your main goal. Also use a title for all diagrams, tasks, etc.

### Know background of students
Collect information what your students already know by asking them or doing a survey before the seminar.

### Dramaturgy of presentations
Read about how theater plays, shows, or books are structured to have a rising tension and climax.

### Check & Cross
Repeat things, and see what your students have learned (see handout).

### Upside down
Ask a question for the opposite (e.g. “How to make the worst possible seminar?”). Makes students think and suggests better ways to do it.

### Yes/No poll
Find out what students know/think by raising their hand.

### Small exercises
All kinds of mini-games like Brainstorming, Finding pairs, Upside-down etc encourage your students to participate and makes the session more interactive.

### Dot Voting
Each student adds a few dots to vote for his favorite options.
