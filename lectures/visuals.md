### Pin board

One of the most useful visual media are pin boards. You can use it to attach paper cards or posters using pin needles. It allows you to combine prepared with ad-hoc content and to rearrange items on the fly.

Methodically, it is a versatile medium usable for many types of brainstorming, repeating and otehr activities.

Most classrooms don't have a pin board, but if you have or can get a pin board or wall, it gives you a lot of space to organize thoughts.


### Whiteboard

Whiteboards are great because your class can witness the process of creation. When explaining math, this is invaluable. Because you can wipe it quickly while presenting it also provides a lot of effective space.

A legible font and space allocation needs a bit of exercise. If you start using a whiteboard, better prepare it before the lesson.

Make sure to keep the whiteboard markers separate from your permanent markers.

### Flipchart

Hot tip: get wax crayons to beautify whatever you write/draw.


### Magnets

On whiteboards and flipcharts, you can use **magnets** to attach material you would otherwise use pins for. You can do useful things with magnets: Attach **prepared pictures** on-the-fly or things created during the session. The magnets let you **move around cards and other elements**, so you can cluster items, highlight key points, or create a live visualization. Most of all, you don't end up in the sticky tape hell when you have magnets at hand.

However, there are some pitfalls to avoid:

* Get good magnets of 3-4 cm diameter. Too weak or too strong magnets ruin your day.
* Before your session, align the magnets on the side of the board. This avoids that you play with them in your hands.
* **Never pull a magnet across the surface of a whiteboard**. It ruins them more than a permanent marker.
* Keep the magnets separate from your electronic equipment, especially your laptops hard disk.
* Try not to mix colors, they confuse. Sometimes I use single big red magnet to highlight things on the board - e.g. the current point of an agenda.

With these things in mind, magnets are a useful little helper that make your day at the board a pleasant one.
