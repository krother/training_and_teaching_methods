# Mind Mapping

### Time

10-30 minutes

### Material

board or drawing paper

### How to do it
Write the topic of your lesson in the middle of the board. Ask for things connected to that. Write them on the board, connected by arrows (or without). This is a faster way to get started into a new topic than e.g. affinity grouping.

As a variation, have students draw mind maps and compare them (good reflection exercise).

### Comments
