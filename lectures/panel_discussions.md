# Organizing a Panel Discussion

**Good conferences and good teaching thrive on interaction.** Naturally, presentations are not very interactive. Giving some room for discussion might be a good alternative. In practice, this can be done as a moderated **panel discussion**.

Here is A small guide to organize a panel discussion

### Step 1: Find 2-4 people for the discussion panel

On a conference, these should be carefully selected experts that represent a variety of backgrounds and opinions. Try to keep your panel well-balanced. Three experts representing *one option* and only one favoring *an alternative* are not a good idea.

### Step 2: Find a chairperson

This should be a respected and comunicative fellow that moderates the discussion. The chairperson should be modest enough to not talk by himself all the time, but rather guide the flow of the meeting. The chairpersons mood will have great influence on the panel members and the audience.

### Step 3: Set a title for the entire session

Open questions are generally more encouraging, e.g. *"What comes after machine learning?".* You can vizualize the title by projecting it on a screen or writing it on a board in big letters. Also the total time for the panel discussion should be known to everybody well in advance.

### Step 4: Prepare the room

The panel and chairperson should sit behind a table. Without the table the panel may feel exposed and uncomfortable. If the audience is larger, an elevated table is better. If the room is smaller, you may put name tags on the table.

### Step 5: The chairperson briefs the experts

Tell the panel in advance how you are going to start (e.g. by introducing everybody). Tell them what is the time limit for each answer (if any) and how you will remind them if they go over time. Ask them for questions. Be nice to them.

### Step 6: The chairperson opens the meeting

Announce the title, Welcome the experts and guests. Give the experts time to introduce themselves.

### Step 7: The chairperson moderates the discussion

Your job as a chairperson is to collect questions from the audience, rephrase them clearly, and pass them to the experts without further comment. Eventually, experts may want to take over questions from each other. Also, you need to track time. Generally your job is not so much to talk, but to encourage the others to do so. 

Moderating a Panel discussion can be challenging. It is the moderators duty to stick to the topic and to stop individual pan
elists from talking too much. More details have been written by [Exec-Comms](http://www.exec-comms.com/blog/2010/08/02/10-tips-on-moderating-a-panel-discussion/) and [Guy Kawasaki](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/03/how_to_be_a_gre.html#axzz24DP2Qkr5)

### Step 8: The chairperson closes the meeting

Announce that the discussion is near the end. Give each panel member room for some closing remarks. Thank everybody for coming. Thank your panel in private as well - after all, it is them who made the discussion happen.

## Panel discussions in teaching

This is a good way to recapitulate or repeat what your students have learned. In that case you split your class into a smaller group (the panel) and a bigger (the audience). Give the audience time to prepare questions while you brief the panel. In case the audience runs out of questions, you might want to have a few spare questions. Don't take the discussion too serious - it is a good occasion to have fun and still do something useful. And after all, your students will exercise for their first real panel discussion.
