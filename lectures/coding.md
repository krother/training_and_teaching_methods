## Using code examples

### Impressive code

Demonstrate a program doing something impressive.
Execute it step by step and discuss it.

It helps to have a prepared list of questions.

### Comparison

Prepare two alternative implementations

### Explain code

Share short code sniplets to pairs of participants. Let them execute the code and explain how it works. Supplement their reports.


## Live coding

According to *Greg Wilson*, live coding is the essence for any programming course.
Seeing live coding, as opposed to seeing the finished code, transfers many key skills like debugging and seeing that teachers make lots of mistakes, too.

There are different ways to do live coding:

### Warm-up coding

Type something easy for 5-10 minutes that everyone can follow along.

### Coding lecture

Introduce a new concept by writing a new program.

### Coding Challenge

Present a coding task/Kata, wait for suggestions from participants

### Hotseat Kata

Present a coding task, rotate the person coding every 5 minutes. Volunteers only!

### Kata in pairs

Present a coding task, have two people take a hotseat or the entire group work in pairs.

### Refactoring

Clean up an example program together.

### Break the code

Collect various ways to break a program.

## Code Reviews

Like in software engineering, code reviews are an essential skill.

* Read code in a team and assess readability, structure etc.
* Peer review (participants review each others projects)
* Review code of your participants and provide feedback (time-consuming)

## Reduced examples

Writing a program from scratch is difficult. It works better to provide a **reduced example**, where a clear problem-solving strategy is made available:

* code with gaps		
* sort code lines		
* sort code blocks
* fix unindented code
* empty function headers
* sequence of small tasks
* pseudocode
* fix buggy code
