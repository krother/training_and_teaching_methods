## Description

Write the outline of your presentation on the board or a slide. Attach a marker to the first item before your start. Advance it while you go through your talk. If you have little space, you can -replace the outline by a 0-100% scale or a series of circles that get filled as the presentation proceeds. The advancing progress bar helps your audience to keep focused because they know how much they still have to endure.
