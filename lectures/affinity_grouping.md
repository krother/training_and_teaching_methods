# Affinity grouping

**Structure a lot of information with the group, e.g. for planning a
longer work session.**

### Time in class

45 minutes

### Group size

up to 20

### What you need

* whiteboard or pinboard
* cards
* marker pens
* magnets or pins

### How it is done

Requires having information on a number of cards in random order on the
board (can be collected by brainstorming). Ask students to suggest how
these could be clustered. Wait for suggestions and move the cards
accordingly. Moderate the discussion but donâ€™t interfere with the
suggestions.

Ask for titles for each cluster and write them on the board.\
Afterwards, you can have the group prioritize the groups by voting with
small objects (magnets, crystals, chips, tokens)

### Comments

This is a very powerful method that can provide a work plan for weeks or
months.
