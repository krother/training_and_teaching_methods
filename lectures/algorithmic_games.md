# Algorithmic games

**Boost motivation before the theory.**

Invent a paper version of an algorithm that you need to explain. Write
down the instructions as pseudocode. Give out items representing
the data, so that the trainees will be able to ”execute” the program.

In most cases, even a simplified representation allows experiments on
execution time, order of exercution etc.

### Example: Tree Traversal

An exercise for a tree traversal algorithm. At least seven students
arrange themselves as a binary tree (because they have only two arms to
point at each other). Requires a ball or small object, which the trainer
gives to the root node when everybody knows the instructions. You can
give numbers or pseudonyms to the nodes (works better than the real
names for some reason).

    Pseudocode:

    1. If you get the ball from behind:
       - call your name.
       - give the ball to the person at your left arm.

    2. If you get the ball from your left:
       - give it to the person at your right arm.

    3. If you get the ball from your right:
       - give it to the person behind you.
