# Asking Questions

## Fact-based questions

*“Which software is most commonly used for creating spreadsheets?"*

* answer is right or wrong
* dangerous (not stimulating up to intimidating)
* work better during repeating sessions

## Opinion-based questions

*"What is your opinion on Excel?"*

* safe
* everybody can answer them
* reduce anxiety
* answers may lack substance
* is a 'temperature check'

## Comparison-based questions

*"How would you compare Excel and OpenOffice?"*

* more substance
* complex
* encourage discussion

## Experience-based questions

*“What have you done with Excel so far?"*

* safe
* connect course contents to the real world
* motivating

## Case-history-based questions

*“You have a table containing 1000 rows and 5 columns. You need to show the most frequently occurring elements for each column. How can you show this information in one diagram?"*

* very complex
* answer requires application of skills

## Questions guided at single participants

* very risky and discouraging. Don't do it!
* work better if presented as a round of questions to everybody, quiz etc.
* if you need to assign questions to single participants, use a random mechanism.
* if you ask a question, tell the name at the end, so that the other participants will think, too.

## Overhead question

directed to everybody

* not risky at all.
* asymmetric participation is typical.

## Relay question

passing the same question around from one person to the other.

* good to involve everybody.
* gets boring with more than 10 participants

## Reverse technique

*“What would you say?”*

* participant asks the question
* you redirect the question back to the trainee or relay to the group.

## Brainstorming

**Collect a pool of uncriticized ideas**

### Time in class

5 minutes

### Group size

any

### What you need

something to write on

### How it is done

Write an understandable formulation of a new topic on the board. Ask
the students for ideas. Write everything on the board they say. Continue
until they run out of ideas or the board is full. Only after that, add
from your notes.

### Example

For a subject about *“Data”,* the question could be *“What data do
programmers need to store?”.*
