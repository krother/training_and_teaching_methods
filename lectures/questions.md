## Questions

Let's take a look at one of your most important teaching tools: Questions.

* Questions play a key role in teaching.
* Questions make us think.
* Questions tell you what students are thinking about.

Some of the best teaching I witnessed was more of a dialogue than anything like a lecture.
Ideally, both teacher and participants ask questions.
Finally, questions allow you to guide what students think about.

Let's take a look what type of questions there are:

### Fact-based questions

*“Which software is most commonly used for creating spreadsheets?"*

* answer is right or wrong
* dangerous (not stimulating up to intimidating)
* work better during repeating sessions

### Opinion-based questions

*"What is your opinion on Excel?"*

* safe
* everybody can answer them
* reduce anxiety
* answers may lack substance
* is a 'temperature check'

### Comparison-based questions

*"How would you compare Excel and OpenOffice?"*

* more substance
* complex
* encourage discussion

### Experience-based questions

*“What have you done with Excel so far?"*

* safe
* connect course contents to the real world
* motivating

### Case-history-based questions

*“You have a table containing 1000 rows and 5 columns. You need to show the most frequently occurring elements for each column. How can you show this information in one diagram?"*

* very complex
* answer requires application of skills

### Questions guided at single participants

* very risky and discouraging. Don't do it!
* work better if presented as a round of questions to everybody, quiz etc.
* if you need to assign questions to single participants, use a random mechanism.
* if you ask a question, tell the name at the end, so that the other participants will think, too.

### Overhead question

directed to everybody

* not risky at all.
* asymmetric participation is typical.

### Relay question

passing the same question around from one person to the other.

* good to involve everybody.
* gets boring with more than 10 participants

### Reverse technique

*"Is Windows or Linux better?" – “What would you say?”*

* participant asks the question
* you redirect the question back to the trainee or relay to the group.

### Rhetorical questions

*"What is the Big-O-notation? Let's take a look at the definition"*

* you ask a question.
* after a short pause, you answer the question yourself.

The rhetorical question is a trick to focus attention.
You can use it to emphasize that an important fact is coming.

### Suggestive questions

*"Who would not think that it is worth learning binary code?"*

This type of questions is more useful for a demagogic speech.
I can't think of a situation where one should use that in a classroom.
