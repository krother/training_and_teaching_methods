## How it is done

At the beginning of a course spanning multiple days, ask your participants to answer three questions, e.g:

* Why did you sign up for the course?
* What do you already know about programming?
* What would you like to learn during the course?

The participants write down their answers and read them aloud. Attach all cards with answers in the room. During the final session of the course, ask every participant to review and report on their expectations from the first day.

## Benefits for the teacher

You can adjust your course to the situation at hand. You can fine-tune your material. You don't need to spend sleepless nights creating new material: Focus on the parts participants ask for, give more room to Q & A or even kick out a topic completely. Explaining one straightforward example that students want to hear is much better than ten examples which they are not interested in.

## Benefits for participants

Asking participants at the very beginning shares responsibility. It also helps them to focus on what they need to learn. After all, they will be distracted by many things while programming.

When reviewing the expectations at the end of the course, participants will see what has changed for them. Their expectations will have time-traveled so that they can compare with their former *self* from the past. Discovering how you have developed during a few days is very powerful. Participants commented when reviewing expectations:

* *"I am not afraid any more."*
* *"I learned a lot."*
* *"Asking us for our point of view shows you care"*

Collecting and reviewing expectations sets a clear frame for your entire course. The expectations establish a double feedback loop. You can improve your course, and your students will see what has improved for them.
