# Managing Expectations

Meeting the expectations of your participants is one of your duties as a teacher. Meeting expectations could mean very diverse things: proceeding on a learning path, passing an exam, solving a business problem, not getting bored and many more.

If participants feel their expectations are not met, they get distracted easily, and it becomes more difficult to learn anything. On the other hand, expectations that are met, boost their motivation and makes their learning more productive. Thus, satisfying expectations makes your job easier and more rewarding.
In the long run, satisfying expectations helps you to get paid. Taken together, expectation management is a basic survival skill for a teacher.

In a programming course, learning about expectations also means learning about the existing skills of your participants. Programming is one of those topics where a few days experience make the difference between being overwhelmed and being bored. It is inevitable that you find out where the sweet spot of your participants is (and whether it is a broad or narrow distribution).

To meet expectations, they need to be managed a bit.
Expectation management was one of the most important things that I learned while teaching.
It takes asking participants for their expectations and a bit of sales skills.
