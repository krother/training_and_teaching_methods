## How it is done

* ask your participants to sort themselves according to their programming experience
* point out where the levels are located in the room (on a 1-5 scale)
* give the group some time to sort
* ask a few representative members to describe their experience, starting from the beginners
* ask 1-2 extra questions, e.g. what is their background and what they would like to learn
* in the end, introduce yourself

If you have a big group, it may help to mark the scale in the room

## Comments

You may give the students some time to bond by asking them to chat about their experience in their respective group.
The answers you will get will be more representative then.
