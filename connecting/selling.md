People have 4 preferences how they would like to consume knowledge. Taking all four into account in the order:

* Why should I pay attention?
* What is the lesson about?
* How will the lesson take place?
* What interesting things can I expect?

A one-minute technique for expectation management is to answer each of the four questions briefly. This way, you address the needs of all participants. Planning for the answers help you to construct an interesting lesson.

*4-Mat is a method attributed to Bernice McCarthy, 1979*
