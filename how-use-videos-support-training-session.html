<h1>How to use Videos to support a Training Session?</h1>

<p align="justify">A couple of months ago, <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://gtpb.igc.gulbenkian.pt/bicourses/"><b>Pedro Fernandes</b></a> suggested spicing up a training session by showing a brief video clip at the beginning. Since then, I have been using videos in several training scenarios. In this article, you find three scenarios described.</p>

<h3>1. Show a video to motivate</h3><div class="media"><iframe class="media-object" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/R4-c3hUhhyc" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" ></iframe><div class="media-body"><p align="justify">At the beginning of a two-day Biopython programming course for 15 people, the video <i><b><a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4-c3hUhhyc">"Sickle Cell Disease"</a></b></i> by <b>Paulo and Alia Naoum</b> was shown. The 5:29 video clip explains the molecular basis of the disease from DNA to protein to symptoms in a patient. The main task on the first day was to develop an experimental test for the disease. All programming exercises related to sickle-cell anemia (retrieving and analysing protein and DNA sequences, for example). Showing the video established a common ground for all participants. The participants were given the same background knowledge, and connecting the exercises to a concrete disease gave them a purpose. As a result, the video helped the entire course to move into one direction.</p></div></div>

<h3>2. Show a video to deepen knowledge</h3><div class="media"><iframe class="media-object" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GGbsgs611MM" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe><div class="media-body"><p align="justify">During a two-day course on the Scrum methodology for 20 people, the video <i><b><a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGbsgs611MM">“Sh**t Bad Scrum Masters Say”</a></b></i> by <b>Adam Weisbart</b> was shown. The 3:18 video clip shows a series of exaggerated mistakes of a Scrum team facilitator. The course participants already had experience as a Scrum team, and had learned basic facts during the training. The participants were given the task to note what was wrong prior to showing the video. After watching the clip, the group reported their notes, which the trainer compared to a prepared list. A few extra questions were clarified in a brief discussion. Effectively the participants not only applied their knowledge, but by observing a (staged) team they could reflect on their own style of work.</p></div></div>

<h3>3. Show a video to guide a discussion</h3><div class="media"><iframe class="media-object" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RVoz_pEeV8I" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe><div class="media-body"><div align="justify"><p>At the beginning of a 90-minute meeting of a peer support group, the first six minutes of the video about <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVoz_pEeV8I"><i><b>The Cloud</b></i></a> by <b>Uri Alon</b> were shown. In the video recording of a <b><a target="_blank" title="" href="http://www.ted.com/">TED talk</a></b>, Uri explains a model how scientists get stuck and unstuck again. The group subsequently discussed for one hour the <i>“crisis of meaning”</i> in science. The purpose of showing the video was to prevent the discussion from drifting into a series of complaints. Showing the video achieved three things: First, it provided a model and vocabulary by which the group could express their own situation more precisely. Second, it established a positive tone from the beginning by stating that crises are normal events that can be resolved.&nbsp; Third, it set a boundary what the discussion would be about. </p></div></div></div>

<h3>Conclusions</h3><div align="justify"><p>In all three scenarios, I found two technical issues essential: The first issue was downloading the video from Youtube to a local file in order circumvent the risk of network failure (there are multiple tools available although many of them are linked to advertisement). The second issue was providing an appropriate sound quality. For the typical course audience a set of small speakers should be sufficient, but laptop speakers clearly are not.</p><p>Taken together, I found showing short videos a versatile method to spice up a training. The three examples described above are only three possible uses.</div>
