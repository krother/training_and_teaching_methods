If your participants are:

* nervous
* frustrated
* have external distractions
* are held back by their own expectations
* have high expectations coming from the outside
* and if the pressure is unevenly distributed

try any of the following

## 1. Teach less

* do not try to squeeze more content in
* focus on the essentials
* leave away stuff
* balance classroom time towards practical exercises
* talk less

## 2. Find easy wins

* do easy exercises instead of challenging ones
* work on open-ended problems (where any solution is great)

## 3. Enhance psychological safety

* ask fewer questions
* favor round-robin questions over open questions
* give participants time to discuss among themselves

## 4. Make room for cooperation

* work on assignments in groups
* if possible, split the groups physically

## 5. Recap

* go over previous content
* apply recap methods (http://www.academis.eu/posts/teaching/wrapping_up/repeat.md)
* review code together
* let them draw the structure of topic X (in pairs)
* show a video
