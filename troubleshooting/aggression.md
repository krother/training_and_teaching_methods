## How to deal with conflicts inside the group

* round where everybody says something
* establish ground rules, e.g.:
* do not interrupt others
* listen

* limit speaking time
* summarize pros and cons, propose solutions

## How to deal with annoying participants

* *"Shields up"*, it is nothing personal. It has nothing to do with you
* redirect statements to the group (*"do you share that point of view?"*)
* use methods that distribute speaking time evenly
* talk to them one-on-one (but do not announce it)
* **DO NOT** criticize them in public
