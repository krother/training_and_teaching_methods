## How to deal with conflicts inside the group

* round where everybody says something
* establish ground rules, e.g.:
* do not interrupt others
* listen
* NO justifications
* everybody is heard
* everybody tells things from their own perspective ("in my opinion..")
* limit speaking time
* summarize pros and cons, propose solutions

## How to deal with verbal attacks directed at you

* *"Shields up"*, do not react, let the attack pass
* redirect criticism to the group (*"do you share that concern?")
* focus on positive people, look at them!
* stick to your structure
* understand the critic
* talk to them one-on-one (but do not announce it)
