## How do I get everyone on board?

* use Round Robin and similar methods
* pair and group assignments (short / sparingly)
* use brainstorming + affinity grouping
* open questions
* discuss questions in pairs before publicly
* work in pairs instead of alone
* address pre-knowledge of participants
* increase psychological safety
* alternate passive and active phases
* talk less
* address concerns, if participants do not participate voluntarily
