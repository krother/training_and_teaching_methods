# How to wake up your class?

Here are my favourite **energizers** – physical activities that get people from their chairs.
They don't fulfill any purpose other than waking up people.

----

## Murmur

Let participants discuss a question, task, problem for 2 minutes among each other before a discourse in class.

This is a very versatile technique that activates your class in many situations.

----

## YMCA

* one person names a concept from the course and makes a gesture/move
* the others repeat the gesture
* the second person repeats the previous moves and adds one to it
* repeat until you have a sequence of 7-8 moves

----

## Scale

Create a scale in the room using cards with numbers (0/25/50/75/100) or words.

Ask a question (*"how much do you know about programming?", "how far away from here do you live?"*)

Participants sort themselves along the scale.

You can ask multiple questions or *"interview"* a few participants to describe their position.

This works great a the beginning of the course or as a feedback method.

----

## Binary count

Count to 15 using the fingers of one of your hands.

----

## Knot

Four people hold a thread or rope in one hand. Create a knot in the middle without letting go of the thread.

----

## Fastball

Pass a ball around so that it touches every hand once. Use a stopwatch to measure the time.
Repeat a few times and optimize.

*a more serious ball activity to introduce Agile concepts is Boris Glogers **"Ball point game"** *

----

## Microwave

A super quick energizer. The microwave has three levels:

1. **hmmmm** - Spread your arms in front of you, so they´re parallel to the ground and move your fingers like starting a wave and hum monotonously.
2. **HMMMM** - like level 1 and aditionally turn around once.
3. **Bing!** - Jump, raise your arm, point to the ceiling and make a noise like „bing!“

----

## Horserace

Tap your hands on your upper legs. Give commands like *"go left", "faster", "jump"* for about a minute.

----

## Clapping
Pass a *"clapping signal"* around in a circle. Clapping twice changes the direction. Making a mistake means you leave the circle.

----

## Ball sequence
Pass a ball in a given sequence arond in the room so that everybody has it once.

Then add more balls.

----

## Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock

Do a best-of-three knockout tournament

----

## Paper plane race

Variation: pairs of participants build the plane using one hand each

----

## Keep balloons floating

* mark a square area on the ground
* give the group one balloon
* ask them to keep it in the air for 5'
* add more balloons

*brought to me by my Sensei Till*

----
## Crowd control
Trainer claps once every 3 secs, invites other trainees to join until the whole room joins --> silence, attention

----

## Energizing presenters
hand on stomach. breathe. rub your hands. arms up, swing your arms, get down, get up, turn around, whoo-heee.
