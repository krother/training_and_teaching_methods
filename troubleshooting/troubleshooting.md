## What are the biggest don'ts?

* don't get personal, ever
* don't use provocative or toxic phrases
* don't use discriminative or pejorative language
* avoid the words *"maybe", "just", "one could" etc.*
* avoid talking for more than 20`
* don't criticise participants's contributions
* never make anyone lose face in the class
* never discuss teaching methods during the course
* never insist on anyone to say something 
* never skip repeating



## How to deal with non-participants

* don't say *"maybe"*
* address disturbance
* talk to them one-on-one (but do not announce it)
* state your point clearly
* understand them
* avoid loaded terms ("roleplay", "groupwork" etc.)

## How to deal with participants that knows each other well

* introduce yourself
* collecting expectations is super important here
* distrust your first impression
* keep the introductions short
* have participants introduce each other 
* let them ask questions about you

## How to create a top-notch training experience

* play music during the breaks (watch IP)
* decorate the training room
* use a strong metaphor
* draw a super nice poster
* address all senses
* sweets etc
* do a small physical exercise
