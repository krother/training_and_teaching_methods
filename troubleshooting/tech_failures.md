# How to deal with technology failures?

Technology is great! It does a lot of useful things, until it doesn't. Then it can ruin your day.

Of course, you can prepare for this day as well. Here are a few common scenarios

## There is no internet

* bring all necessary files on a USB drive
* switch to lesson content that doesn't require the web
* do a coding kata
* repeat

## There is no projection

* structure content from previous lessons on the board together
* discuss business cases
* repeat

## Installing X does not work

* do programming in randomized pairs on the machines that work
* switch to lesson content that doesn't require X
* explore alternatives together

## There are too few computers

* do programming in randomized pairs
* do a hotseat kata
* repeat

## There are no computers

* structure content
* write a program on the board together
* discuss business cases
* do a quiz

## Checklist: Software Installation

Programming is only fun if you already have some programs:

* What operating system is installed?
* Is there a way for you to see a participants' screen?
* Is there a way to project a participants' screen to the entire class?
* Is there a list of installed software or do you need to write one?
* Is there a centralized installation service? How much time in advance do they need?
* Are there any security restrictions regarding software installations or internet connections?
* Do participants have root access to their machines?
* Can you test installation of everything in advance? *(if not, have a backup plan)*
* Have participants worked on the same computers before?
* Have participants used a text editor before?
* Is there a git repository for the course?
* Do participants know how to use git?
* Is there an admin you can call for tech support?
