## Learning Types

One of the most common and widely used categorizations of the various types of learning styles is **Fleming's VARK model** (sometimes VAK) which expanded upon earlier Neuro-linguistic programming (VARK) models:

* visual learners
* auditory learners
* reading-writing preference learners
* kinesthetic learners or tactile learners.

Fleming claimed that visual learners have a preference for seeing (think in pictures; visual aids that represent ideas using methods other than words, such as graphs, charts, diagrams, symbols, etc.). Auditory learners best learn through listening (lectures, discussions, tapes, etc.). Tactile/kinesthetic learners prefer to learn via experience—moving, touching, and doing (active exploration of the world; science projects; experiments, etc.). Its use in instruction allows teachers to prepare classes that address each of these areas. Students can also use the model to identify their preferred learning style and maximize their educational experience by focusing on what benefits them the most.

## Respect

A teacher must not make any group member look like an idiot (“to lose their face”). Depending on the cultural context you put the student or yourself into trouble.

This means: Picking people from the group and questioning them, giving nonconstructive feedback after student presentations are absolute no-gos!


## Managing groups

Partnerarbeit	Genau 1 Aufgabe

group puzzle:
covering 4 different subjects [PUZZLE FIGURE]: alignments, imaging, plots, R. Each group got a few example scripts, an exercise to implement, and a PDF as a reference. Worked independently with small pieces of advice. Then came back to the original group and explained what they had learned to their colleagues. Following the idea 'the best teacher is someone who just learned himself.' Course trainers orchestrated the process.

## Managing Energy

Create a welcoming atmosphere right from the start.

The way humans work is that they tend to reflect the friendliness and enthusiasm of the leader (you). If a lesson is joyful to you, you will incite the others. If you feel insecure or distracted for whatever reason, it will show as well. It is OK that you are teaching a topic for the first time, and asking for help usually works. But don't tell people why you feel terrible and what bad day you had - that intoxicates the climate.

If you spend some longer period of time with the same people, you normally want to know who they are. In a class, you should at least learn their names. Most students appreciate being adressed by their name. Having everybody introduce himself is an excellent opportunity to probe students' expectations and fears.

If you are sharing handouts, tasks or other material to students, they will get excited and distracted from you immediately. Make sure to tell them what they are expected to do before they receive anything.

Ideally, keep the class in the "flow state" - not too easy, not too difficult. To avoid boredom or frustration. With a heterogeneous group this can be quite challenging.

## Attention

The attention of people listening decreases over time. After 20 minutes, many brains switch off unless they have something interesting to do. The trick is to change methods frequently (around every 20 minutes).
