## Learning Types

One of the most common and widely used categorizations of the various types of learning styles is **Fleming's VARK model** (sometimes VAK) which expanded upon earlier Neuro-linguistic programming (VARK) models:

* visual learners
* auditory learners
* reading-writing preference learners
* kinesthetic learners or tactile learners.

Fleming claimed that visual learners have a preference for seeing (think in pictures; visual aids that represent ideas using methods other than words, such as graphs, charts, diagrams, symbols, etc.). Auditory learners best learn through listening (lectures, discussions, tapes, etc.). Tactile/kinesthetic learners prefer to learn via experience—moving, touching, and doing (active exploration of the world; science projects; experiments, etc.). Its use in instruction allows teachers to prepare classes that address each of these areas. Students can also use the model to identify their preferred learning style and maximize their educational experience by focusing on what benefits them the most.

## Managing groups

Partnerarbeit	Genau 1 Aufgabe	

group puzzle:
covering 4 different subjects [PUZZLE FIGURE]: alignments, imaging, plots, R. Each group got a few example scripts, an exercise to implement, and a PDF as a reference. Worked independently with small pieces of advice. Then came back to the original group and explained what they had learned to their colleagues. Following the idea 'the best teacher is someone who just learned himself.' Course trainers orchestrated the process.
Gruppenpuzzle (Stammgruppe, Gemixt in Expertengruppen wo Materialien bearbeitet werden, Rueckkehr), Aufgaben klar stellen --> Viel Zeit geben.
