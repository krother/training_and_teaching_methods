## Learning Types

One widely used categorization of learning styles is **Fleming's VARK model** (sometimes VAK) which expanded upon earlier Neuro-linguistic programming (VARK) models:

* visual learners
* auditory learners
* reading-writing preference learners
* kinesthetic learners or tactile learners.

Fleming claimed that visual learners have a preference for seeing (think in pictures; visual aids that represent ideas using methods other than words, such as graphs, charts, diagrams, symbols, etc.). Auditory learners best learn through listening (lectures, discussions, tapes, etc.). Tactile/kinesthetic learners prefer to learn via experience—moving, touching, and doing (active exploration of the world; science projects; experiments, etc.). Its use in instruction allows teachers to prepare classes that address each of these areas. Students can also use the model to identify their preferred learning style and maximize their educational experience by focusing on what benefits them the most.


## Managing groups


### Group work
Create small groups (2-4 people). Hand out a text or other material. Give a task assignment, e.g. explaing out the method or the main message in the group and presenting it briefly.

covering 4 different subjects [PUZZLE FIGURE]: alignments, imaging, plots, R. Each group got a few example scripts, an exercise to implement, and a PDF as a reference. Worked independently with small pieces of advice. Then came back to the original group and explained what they had learned to their colleagues. Following the idea 'the best teacher is someone who just learned himself.' Course trainers orchestrated the process.

## Managing Energy

If you are sharing handouts, tasks or other material to students, they will get excited and distracted from you immediately. Make sure to tell them what they are expected to do before they receive anything.

The attention of people listening decreases over time. After 20 minutes, many brains switch off unless they have something interesting to do. The trick is to change methods frequently (around every 20 minutes).

## Motivation

Ideally, keep the class in the "flow state" - not too easy, not too difficult. To avoid boredom or frustration. With a heterogeneous group this can be quite challenging.
