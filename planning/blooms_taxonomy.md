# Setting Learning Goals with Blooms Taxonomy

## Learning goals

**A learning goal states what students will be able to *do*
after a lesson.**

Learning goals are your starting point for preparing lessons. They
differ from a **syllabus**, which is a list of topics. Given a syllabus,
you can start creating learning goals.


## Example:

Given a list of topics from the field of carbohydrates, you could
formulate as learning goals:

* Students can draw the chemical structure of glucose.
* Students can recognize fructose, ribose, and saccharose.
* Students can define N- and O-glycosidic bonds.
* Students can calculate the energy gained from glucose.
* Students can evaluate whether their own nutrition is healthy.

Three basic categories of goals can be distinguished:

### 1. Reproduce

The students can **reproduce** knowledge (define, name, list, explain, draw etc.).

**Example:** *“Students can draw the structure of glucose.”*

### 2. Apply

The students can** apply** a skill or scientific model (calculate, apply, conduct an experiment, observe, record, write etc.).

**Example:** *“Students can calculate the energy gained from glucose.”*

### 3. Evaluate

The students can **evaluate** information (judge, test, or discuss a model).

**Example:** *“Students can evaluate whether their own nutrition is healthy.”*

A balanced lesson should contain a lot of learning goals **reproducing**
knowledge, less for **applying**, and few for evaluating.

Adult learners usually have their own personal goals. They are a main
source of their motivation. Finding out what students want and relate
the learning goals to the students' intrinsic motivation is therefore a
good path to successful teaching.

## Blooms taxonomy of cognitive domains

**Blooms Taxonomy of Cognitive Domains** is detailed categorization of learning goals. It is a pyramid that stretches from straightforward to very complex activities. When you are setting learning goals, you can use Blooms Taxonomy to make sure you have a well-balanced mixture of activities. E.g. many reproductive, some analytical and few exercises where students apply their judgement.
