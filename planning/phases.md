## Warming Up

Warming up is very important in a programming course, because it protects your participants from frustration.
The goal is give your participants a feeling of achievement at the very beginning.
Every participant must be able to complete your warm-up activities **easily**.
If you have to think whether an activity might be too challenging, it is too difficult.

Warming up can have a couple of functions:

* **Priming** them for a new topic. I believe this is the most important one.
* repeat concepts from a previous lesson
* make them familiar with exam questions
* help the class to know each other and grow into a team
* make time for students to arrive before you start the main content

Warming up should be short. Make sure you get to the main part after 10-20 minutes.


## Repeating

Repeating key concepts in increasing intervals is crucial for learning success (the scientific term for this is *"spaced repetition"*). Thus, repeating is an essential teaching activity that should not be skipped. However, repeating may be difficult to prepare, because you and your participants may be tired at the end of a day/lesson, and repeating easily falls victim to any changes to your plan. Even if everything goes well, your participants may be very eager to code to the very last minute, and interrupting them would be a pity. General strategies to deal with repeating are:

* Point students to material for self-study – works, because most online training resources do a decent job at repeating.
* Start the next lesson with it – the repetition serves as a warm-up activity
* Keep it short – one well-planned activity at the end of a lesson may prompt
