## Syllabus

Sometimes you get a syllabus â€“ a list of topics you are expected to cover.
A syllabus is raw material for creating lessons.
Usually, nobody will tell you how much of each topic to cover exactly.
That means you have a good deal of flexibility to emphasize topics you find important or can do well.

Sometimes you are expected to write a syllabus from scratch first, or negotiate it with the organizers.
This is a useful step before preparing lessons.
In the chapters **Goals** and **Concept Maps** you find methods to process a syllabus.
