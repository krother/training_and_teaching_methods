# Syllabus

Sometimes you get a syllabus â€“ a list of topics you are expected to cover.
A syllabus is raw material for creating lessons.
Usually, nobody will tell you how much of each topic to cover exactly.
That means you have a good deal of flexibility to emphasize topics you find important or can do well.

Creating a good syllabus from scratch is not easy.
Programming comes with a lot of terminology.
This terminology contains many words that students have heard in a different context.
Here is what someone who never coded might see when they read a raw syllabus:

    Introduction to Programming in Zebra
    ====================================

    - installing Zebra
    - Hi Planet
    - the Zebra Hull
    - integer changeables
    - yarns
    - per circles
    - functions
    - the never..do..this statement
    - truncator expressions
    - file trumpets
    - rivers and sinks
    - instagators for scratching the net
    - citation counting and the trash service

While this syllabus might make perfect sense to you, it requires an effort to translate it to students.
Here is a shorter version:

    Getting Started with Zebra
    ==========================

    - installing Zebra on your computer
    - writing your first program
    - counting to one billion
    - cleaning up your code
    - searching for errors in your program
    - downloading Wikipedia

Many programming teachers have to write their own syllabus.
To write a syllabus, you need to:

* identify the competencies you need to teach
* add sub-points for each of them
* flatten the syllabus, prioritizing some competencies
* rewrite the syllabus in words your students understand

Sometimes you are expected to write a syllabus from scratch first, or negotiate it with the organizers.
This is a useful step before preparing lessons.
In the chapters **Goals** and **Concept Maps** you find methods to process a syllabus.
