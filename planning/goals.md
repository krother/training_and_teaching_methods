**Learning goals are the Unit Tests of your lesson**

## What are Learning Goals?

Often you start planning with a **syllabus**, which is simply a list of topics. For instance, your syllabus could contain the topic

    for loops

This is not a learning goal. At best it is a topic for your lesson.

You could formulate this topic as an ideal final state:

    The participants can implement for loops

However, this is not very useful as a goal, because it is not *specific* enough to be checked. Essentially, it is a wordy version of the topic from the syllabus. A better definition is:
**A learning goal describes what students will do during the lesson.**
Applied to the topic above, a goal could be:

    participants apply for loops to draw geometrical shapes

Coupling your goals directly to the lesson has a couple of advantages:

* it is easy to communicate to the participants
* it can be checked easily; you will see whether your participants achieve that goal or not
* it gives you a specific guideline how to develop your lesson (draw stuff)
* it can still be adjusted in difficulty; you can provide beginners with detailed instructions, advanced participants may figure out by themselves

The outcome of this planning phase is a set of learning goals – 1-3 for a one-hour lesson, 4-10 for a one-day training.


## Blooms Taxonomy

**Blooms Taxonomy** is a textbook technique on learning goals. Blooms Taxonomy categorizes learning goals into a hierarchy according to the *activities* participants perform. These activities range from basic to more complex activities over six levels:

Applied to the `for` loop lesson, we can formulate three goals:

#### Reproduce (levels 1+2)

Participants repeat something they have seen before, e.g.:

    participants explain a for loop drawing a square

#### Apply (levels 3+4)

Participants apply a skill or model to a new situation:

    participants write a for loop creating multiple squares

#### Evaluate (levels 5+6)

Participants evaluate information in the context of a topic:

    participants discuss advantages of for and while loops

A balanced lesson should contain a lot of learning goals **reproducing** knowledge, less for **applying**, and few for evaluating. When setting learning goals, Blooms Taxonomy helps you to choose a well-balanced mixture of activities.

The table below contains keyword you can use to generate ideas for goals on different levels:

| 1. knowledge | 2. comprehension | 3. application  | 4. analysis    | 5. synthesis | 6. evaluate  |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| define    | describe      | implement    | debug          | compose   | advocate  |
| identify  | explain       | execute      | compare        | design    | defend    |
| enumerate | draw          | calculate    | differentiate  | plan      | recommend |
| name      | illustrate    | estimate     | examine        | refactor  | judge     |
| review    | classify      | measure      | investigate    | organize  | assess    |
| recognize | summarize     | demonstrate  | test           | discuss   | suggest   |


## Dimensions of learning goals

If you design a longer course, it is worth thinking of learning goals in a broader perspective. In addition to Blooms Taxonomy, you might consider the level of difficulty:

| difficulty | example |
|------------|---------|
| easy       | participants write a for loop that only contains plotting functions |
| medium     | participants write a for loop containing an if statement |
| hard       | participants write a nested for loops creating a matrix of sqares |

Another dimension are *competencies* that you are training:

| competency | example |
|------------|---------|
| writing code | participants write a for loop drawing geometrical shapes |
| debugging | participants debug a program with a for loop |
| planning | participants draw a flow chart for a for loop |
| communication | participants explain when for loops are useful |
| teamwork | participants review each others loops |

You could combine the three types of goals (Bloom levels, difficulty, competency). That way you end up with `6 * 3 * 5 = 90` possible goals arranged in a 3D matrix. Practically, it does not make any sense to write down the entire matrix or even trying to fully cover it in your lessons. But thinking of teaching goals as a 3D matrix helps to select diverse goals for your course.

## Practical Challenges

Setting Learning Goals as the very first thing when preparing a new topic is difficult. Many times, your goal will be *"survive the lesson"* rather than the detailed goals above. It is OK to start with a goal that is not immediately tested. If your goal is *"participants can implement for loops"*, and you do an exercise or recap session involving a loop, you will quickly observe how much they really understood.

When you feel more secure, e.g. after having taught a topic once or twice, you can move to goals that have more similarity with Unit Tests. You notice immediately when your lesson fails a test, and usually your participants need to be less active for you to get the feedback – you already know what to check.
