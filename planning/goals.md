# Learning Goals

**Learning goals are the Unit Tests of your lesson**

Setting learning goals are a good first step during course preparation.
You would start with the **syllabus**, which is simply a list of topics. A syllabus could contain the topic

    for loops

You could formulate this topic as an ideal final state:

    The participants can implement for loops

However, this is not a very useful formulation, because it is not *specific* enough to be checked. Essentially, it is a wordy version of the topic from the syllabus. A better definition is:
**A learning goal describes what students will do during the lesson.**
Applied to the topic above, a goal could be:

    participants apply for loops to draw geometrical shapes

This goal has a couple of advantages:

* it is easy to communicate to the participants
* it can be checked easily; you will see whether your participants achieve that goal or not
* it gives you a specific guideline how to develop your lesson (draw stuff)
* it can still be adjusted in difficulty; you can provide beginners with lots of helpful material and give advanced participants the goal and let them figure out the rest

The outcome of this planning phase is a set of learning goals â€“ 1-3 for a one-hour lesson, 4-10 for a one-day training.


## Blooms Taxonomy

**Blooms Taxonomy of Cognitive Domains** is detailed categorization of learning goals. It is a hierarchy that stretches from basic to more complex activities. It contains three main categories:

![Blooms Taxonomy](../images/blooms_taxonomy.png)

#### Reproduce (levels 1+2)

Participants repeat something they have seen before, e.g.:

    participants explain a for loop drawing a square

#### Apply (levels 3+4)

Participants apply a skill or model to a new situation:

    participants write a for loop creating a list of numbers

#### Evaluate (levels 5+6)

Participants evaluate information in the context of a topic:

    participants discuss advantages of for and while loops

A balanced lesson should contain a lot of learning goals **reproducing** knowledge, less for **applying**, and few for evaluating. When setting learning goals, Blooms Taxonomy helps you to choose a well-balanced mixture of activities.

The table below contains keyword you can use to generate ideas for goals on different levels:

| 1. knowledge | 2. comprehension | 3. application  | 4. analysis    | 5. synthesis | 6. evaluate  |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| define    | describe      | implement    | debug          | compose   | advocate  |
| identify  | explain       | execute      | compare        | design    | defend    |
| enumerate | draw          | calculate    | differentiate  | plan      | recommend |
| name      | illustrate    | estimate     | examine        | refactor  | judge     |
| review    | classify      | measure      | investigate    | organize  | assess    |
| recognize | summarize     | demonstrate  | test           | discuss   | suggest   |


## Dimensions of learning goals

If you design a longer course, it is worth thinking of learning goals in a broader perspective. In addition to Blooms Taxonomy, you might consider the level of difficulty:

| difficulty | example |
|------------|---------|
| easy       | participants write a for loop without further control structures |
| medium     | participants write a for loop containing if and continue statements |
| hard       | participants write nested for loops creating a table |

Another dimension are the *competencies* that you are training:

| competency | example |
|------------|---------|
| writing code | participants write a for loop drawing geometrical shapes |
| reading code | participants debug a program with a for loop |
| planning | participants draw a flow chart for a for loop |
| communication | participants explain when for loops are useful |

Together, these dimensions create a 3D matrix of possible goals. Practically, you cannot cover the entire matrix in your lessons. The art of creating a good course is to have goals from many diverse areas of this goal matrix.
