# Concept Maps

**A concept map is a structured visualization of a topic showing no more than seven concepts.**

Humans gather most information visually. Therefore, a visual presentation of a subject facilitates understanding. A key point in lesson preparation is to prepare a visual overview of the subject. I refer to such visualizations as **Concept Maps**.

Concept maps can be depicted as mind maps, diagrams, flowcharts, or use a visual metaphor:

## Concepts

To a student a new, unknown topic looks at first interesting, but also big and intimidating. So the first thing you should do is to chop it up into small parts the students can digest more easily. They have a right to know what is expecting them.

**Don't teach facts, teach concepts.**

A concept is an idea that can be applied in multiple contexts to explain and/or predict outcomes.

**Conceptual understanding** is the ability to apply an idea in multiple contexts to explain and/or predict outcomes.

## Content Reduction

A good concept map limits itself to the most important aspects of a field. There should be no more than 5-9 points in one map, because of the **working memory limit* of seven plus/minus two** (as described by George Miller). If have more concepts and need more details, you can build an information hierarchy. Zoom into one particular aspect of your concept map and explain it on a separate diagram. Alternatively you can annotate the initial map further as soon as your students have digested the initial map.

A concept map serves many purposes: introducing a subject, showing an overview, repeating, displaying what a certain part of a tutorial focuses on etc. A well-crafted concept map serves as the backbone of your teaching unit.

## How to develop a concept map

***How to find out what to include in a concept map***

When teaching academic subjects, a frequent problem is that the field is
very broad, especially if you know it well. For the student, such a high
amount of information can be easily overwhelming.

**Content reduction** is a powerful technique for preparing lessons. It
structures a subject both for you and the students. As a result, you
will obtain a **concept map**, a visual representation of the subject.

Here is how it works:

### 1. Collect topics you wish to cover

Write down all topics that are
necessary to achieve the **learning goal** and that you would like
to cover in the tutorial on a separate sheet of paper. Often, you
can use topics directly from the course **syllabus**.

### 2. Cluster the content

Group the topics, until you have
4-7 clusters. Give each cluster a name. By presenting the clusters,
you give your students **mental boxes** so that they can sort
content more easily. Bear in mind that there is not one single
true clustering.

### 3. Draw a concept map

Visualize your clusters on a separate sheet
of paper as a **mind map**, diagram, or a picture with the clusters
as labels. The concept map can be used as an **outline** of
your lesson.
