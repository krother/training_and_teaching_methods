# Teach concepts

**Don't teach facts, teach concepts.**

A concept is an idea that can be applied in multiple contexts to explain and/or predict outcomes.

**Conceptual understanding** is the ability to apply an idea in multiple contexts to explain and/or predict outcomes.

Develop formative assessments for the most important concepts:

* identify concepts to be tested
* identify misconceptions
* construct the assessment
* validate the test (with novices and experts)
* use the test

## Setting learning goals

* A syllabus is not a set of learning goals
* Set learning goals with Bloom levels in mind (aim higher!).
* Set learning goals that you can assess.
* Make your learning goals explicit.
* Make your goals the students' learning goals, by matching Bloom levels of your goals to your instruction, assignments, review, and assessments.
* Specific learning outcomes are more easily assessable than broad learning goals.


## Myth debunking

### Common beliefs in academic teaching staff:

* The most efficient and the only practical way to teach a large (>50) class is by lecturing.
* Students will (or at least should) understand and remember everything they are told in a lecture.
* The best use of class time is to transmit information by lecturing; time spent on discussion or other activities is less valuable or wasted.
* The more an instructor covers in a lecture course, the more the students will learn.
* Students will only learn in a course to the extent that the instructor teaches them (presents and explains the material in lectures).
* A detailed syllabus is a better way to convey the content of a course than a set of specific student learning goals.

### Common beliefs of students:

* Lectures are the only format that makes sense for a large class.
* If I just attend class regularly, do the assigned reading with a highlighter, take good notes in class, and review them on my own before the exam, I will learn and retain the course material and get a good grade in the course.
* In a large class, I'm learning most when the instructor is lecturing and Iâ€™m taking notes. When an instructor spends class time on discussions or group work rather than presenting the course material, then he is wasting valuable class time.
* The more the instructor covers in a course, the more I will learn and retain from it.
* It is the job of the instructor to teach us, not make us learn on our own.
* A detailed syllabus will be more helpful to me in studying for the exams than a set of student learning goals.
