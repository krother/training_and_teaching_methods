Learning Goals
==============

Often you start planning with a **syllabus**, a list of topics.
For instance, your syllabus could contain the topic

::

   for loops

You could start putting together a lesson that covers everything
that you consider important about for loops.
You could generate lots of content, or even have an AI generate the content.
However, focusing on the content alone makes it very easy to miss the needs of your students.
*for loops* is a topic, not a learning goal.

You could try to formulate the desired outcome instead:

::

   The students understand for loops

However, this goal is not very useful in practice.
You cannot look into a students head and see whether they understood anything.
You personal impression is highly subjective,
and if you want to assess students' knowledge, they are at the mercy of your interpretation.
As a goal, *"understanding"* is not *specific*, it is not *testable* and *hard to communicate.*
Essentially, it is a wordy version of the topic from the syllabus.

Write testable learning goals
-----------------------------

Let's borrow another analogy from programming.
We write a Unit Test for our lesson.
Here is a learning goal that is both **specific** and **testable**:

::

   The students use a for loop
   to draw multiple squares

Now you can use the goal to check whether your lesson is working.
Coming by a students computer, you will see whether there are multiple squares on the screen.
If yes, your Unit Test passes. The lesson seems to work.
If not, you may need to provide extra support.

But it gets even better: a good learning goal is specific enough that
students can assess themselves.
You could give them the information:

::

   The goal of this lesson is that you draw multiple squares with a for loop.

Knowing the goal gives students something to strive for.
You give them the chance to reach the goal *by themselves* and
go home with the feeling of accomplishment.
Also, if students can self-check, you have more time to help people.
A single, well-crafted learning goal may power an entire lesson.


Adjust Difficulty
-----------------

A great thing about testable learning goals is that the same goal works
for participants with varying skill levels.
Of course, you can make the task itself more or less difficult:

========== ==============================================================================
difficulty example
========== ==============================================================================
easy       write a for loop that calls the ``draw_square()`` function 3 times.
medium     write a for loop that draws 10 squares in random positions.
hard       write two nested for loops creating a matrix of sqares
========== ==============================================================================

Alternatively, you can provide more or fewer hints.
See :ref:`faded_examples` for more ways to adjust difficulty.

How many goals should a lesson have?
------------------------------------

For a lesson of 45-90 minutes, one learning goal is sufficient.
For an entire training day, you could plan 3-5 goals.
Set these goals so that fit logically, e.g. topics or activities that structure the day.
You find a list of possible activities in :ref:`blooms_taxonomy`.

However, if your day involves an intense period where participants work
by themselves you may want to give them a set of micro-goals
that guide them through the process.

Should you communicate goals to the students?
---------------------------------------------

Yes it helps to communicate **one** goal at the start of the lesson.
This is a great way to motivate the group.

However, if you have doubts whether your lesson is going to work,
you might leave the lesson more open-ended, so that there is less pressure on you.

Do you need a goal for every lesson?
------------------------------------

Setting a learning goals when teaching a topic for the first time is difficult.
Many times, your goal will be *“survive the lesson and see how things work”*.
Rather than the detailed goals above. It is OK to start with a goal that is not immediately tested.

A safe strategy for new topics (and groups) is to give an *easy assignment* as homework.
When you feel more secure, e.g. after having taught a topic once or
twice, you can formulate more specific goals.

Learning goals are like Unit Tests
----------------------------------

You can think of well-written learning goals as Unit Tests for your lesson.
If your students reach the goal, the test passes.
If the test fails, you know that you need to change your approach, e.g. to provide extra hints.

Taken together, writing specific, testable goals helps you to:

-  communicate to students what they are expected to do
-  check the outcome of your lesson; you will see whether your participants achieve the goal or not
-  let participants self-check their own progress
-  prepare material - everything that your students need to achieve the goal
-  adjust a lesson for multiple audiences and heterogenous groups.
