# Equipment

* Marker pens + paper cards do wonders. With them, it is not that difficult to improvise exercises where people can actively participate.
* Useful acessoires for that are also glue tape, magnets (for attaching stuff on a white board), and scissors.
* A big roll of paper can be used by trainees to draw posters, mind maps, or results in pairs or small groups (paper is cheaply available e.g. at IKEA).
* Can you use 2D or 3D models to support your topic?

A trainers toolbox should include:

* good pens
* cards
* a few prepared posters/slides
* list of methods
* sticky dots
* something to randomly assign groups
* sweets
* ball or throwable item
* painters tape
* scissors
* timer
* pins
