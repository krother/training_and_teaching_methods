# Teachers

Once upon a time, a teacher was the main source of information in the  classroom. But today, course participants find information on any programming topic or entire courses themselves in no time. In comparison, lecturing is an ineffective method to convey information: You have to guess what information your participants are looking for, prepare it in the right granularity and convey it at the right pace. It's a risky business.

But learning to program is something else than attentively listening and taking notes anyway. To learn it, you need to do it. And this is where the real fun begins. Beginners typically face a lot of practical questions:

* Which Python version should I install?
* Should I use `for` loop, a `while` loop or maybe `break`?
* What do all these controls in my IDE do?
* Which of the 1000 packages/libraries/tools should I learn?
* What is a `UnicodeError`, a `Makefile`, or a `git pull`?
* I have an error message that spans 3 screen pages. Help!

It is easy to get lost in the abundant information. Here, participants need your help. Your role is that of a *learning facilitator*: Show them a path and walk that path with them.

## Welcoming

Create a welcoming atmosphere right from the start.

The way humans work is that they tend to reflect the friendliness and enthusiasm of the leader (you). If a lesson is joyful to you, you will incite the others. If you feel insecure or distracted for whatever reason, it will show as well. It is OK that you are teaching a topic for the first time, and asking for help usually works. But don't tell people why you feel terrible and what bad day you had - that intoxicates the climate.

If you spend some longer period of time with the same people, you normally want to know who they are. In a class, you should at least learn their names. Most students appreciate being adressed by their name. Having everybody introduce himself is an excellent opportunity to probe students' expectations and fears.

## Respect

A teacher must not make any group member look like an idiot (“to lose their face”). Depending on the cultural context you put the student or yourself into trouble.

This means: Picking people from the group and questioning them, giving nonconstructive feedback after student presentations are absolute no-gos!
