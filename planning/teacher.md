# Teachers

You as a teacher are the compiler and the runtime environment.

Once upon a time, a teacher was the main source of information in the  classroom. But today, course participants find information on any programming topic or entire courses themselves in no time. In comparison, lecturing is an ineffective method to convey information: You have to guess what information your participants are looking for, prepare it in the right granularity and convey it at the right pace. It's a risky business.

But learning to program is something else than attentively listening and taking notes anyway. To learn it, you need to do it. And this is where the real fun begins. Beginners typically face a lot of practical questions:

* Which Python version should I install?
* Should I use `for` loop, a `while` loop or maybe `break`?
* What do all these controls in my IDE do?
* Which of the 1000 packages/libraries/tools should I learn?
* What is a `UnicodeError`, a `Makefile`, or a `git pull`?
* I have an error message that spans 3 screen pages. Help!

It is easy to get lost in the abundant information. Here, participants need your help. Your role is that of a *learning facilitator*: Show them a path and walk that path with them.
