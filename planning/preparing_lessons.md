## Preparing lessons

The attention of people listening decreases over time. After 20 minutes, many brains switch off unless they have something interesting to do. The trick is to change methods frequently (around every 20 minutes).

A **syllabus**, a list of the topics, is only the first step in preparation. A properly prepared lesson consists of specific **learning objectives** that you can assess (or ideally your participants can assess themselves).

It is useful to prepare a **lesson plan**, a table listing the topics for a lesson, the methods you are going to use and the time you plan for this.

A Klingon proverb says: “Planning ends with enemy contact.”. Especially when you start teaching, your time estimates will be plain wrong. Be ready to recognize the moment at which to trash your lesson plan and improvise.

## What does a lesson consist of?

A well-prepared lesson contains:

* a list of around 7 key cocepts
* a learning goal
* a problem statement
* a concept map
* data
* media
* learning material
* exercises
* tools (programs, libraries, teaching methods)
* lesson plan

Material prepared along these categories can be used in many ways. Even if you have half of these, the lesson is already very solid. It makes it much easier to modify one component and re-fit the lesson to another situation (more/less time, bigger/smaller/more experienced group).


## The Classroom

The position of tables, the lectern, projectors, power sockets, screens etc. is crucial. Tables and laptops are psychological barriers that  both students and teachers use to entrench themselves behind. If there are too many barriers, it is difficult to establish a dialogue.

For a more communicative atmosphere, you should move tables aside if possible. The chairs can be arranged in a circle or half-circle. Of course this will only work if you get rid of your defences as well. Employ students to help with rearranging furniture.

## Managing Energy

Create a welcoming atmosphere right from the start.

The way humans work is that they tend to reflect the friendliness and enthusiasm of the leader (you). If a lesson is joyful to you, you will incite the others. If you feel insecure or distracted for whatever reason, it will show as well. It is OK that you are teaching a topic for the first time, and asking for help usually works. But don't tell people why you feel terrible and what bad day you had - that intoxicates the climate.

If you spend some longer period of time with the same people, you normally want to know who they are. In a class, you should at least learn their names. Most students appreciate being adressed by their name. Having everybody introduce himself is an excellent opportunity to probe students' expectations and fears.

If you are sharing handouts, tasks or other material to students, they will get excited and distracted from you immediately. Make sure to tell them what they are expected to do before they receive anything.

Ideally, keep the class in the "flow state" - not too easy, not too difficult. To avoid boredom or frustration. With a heterogeneous group this can be quite challenging.

## Exercises

If your participants need to do something, they need clear instructions.

An example that does not work well:

    Implement the quicksort algorithm.

An example that might work better:

    Complete the quicksort code. Execute the code on the datasets A and B. Measure how long it takes to complete. Compare the performance to Pythons built-in `sort()` function.

## Recipe

A general recipe for preparing lectures, seminars, and practical training:

![seven steps](../images/seven_steps.png)

1. Set a learning goal.
2. Visualize your structure as a concept map
3. Write a lesson plan
4. Reserve time for warming up.
5. Include an exercise where students participate actively.
6. Reserve time for repeating.
7. Have a plan B.


## Construct well-balanced Teaching Units

What is the optimal method for experimental research? Obviously, the answer depends on the subject and on the research hypothesis pursued by your research group. In teaching and training it is the same: Many factors determine how the optimal teaching unit should be structured, such as:

* the subject
* the learning objective
* the group size and their background
* the training room and available equipment
* the time frame
* and of course your personal style as a teacher.

Therefore there is no single best approach, but literally hundreds. The overall setting determines which teaching methods will work best in practice. But how can you systematically construct a teaching unit then?

![teaching phases](../images/teaching_phases.png)

Here, I propose a model consisting of four phases. They provide you with a scaffolding that give you a safe structure to construct quality teaching units from 45 minutes to full days. In each well-built seminar and practical course, you will find the four phases **warm-up, introduce content, apply content,** and **wrap-up**.

### 1. Warm-up

Here, you invite students mentally into your class. You motivate them to learn about the subject and make them ready to think, if necessary (and it should always be necessary). To motivate trainees you can connect the topic at hand to their present knowledge or present a single example of the problem at hand. You can explain the learning goal or give an overview. To make students more active, do a warm-up exercise. Warming up includes as simple things as saying hello (imagine a lecture without; I was told it is very awkward).

### 2. Introduce content

Now you deliver the new content in bite-sized chunks. Your main job as a teacher is not to convey all the facts, as frequently misconceived, but to provide a structure for the topic. Immerse yourself in the structure of your subject, show it, tell it, and repeat the basic concepts and categories again and again. Make it visual. And of course, add the facts, but you don't have to say everything. Your students have not only ears, but also eyes and fingers. A proper piece of text and a figure can provide as much information as a deck of slides.

### 3. Apply content

Give students a chance to apply their new knowledge actively. They need to experience that it is good for something, otherwise adult brains tend to classify it as 'irrelevant' and kick it out the next night (in contrast to children who store everything by default). So, what is the subject you are teaching good for? Can your students do something with it right away? If for some reason a real-world application is not possible (e.g. when you do particle physics), can your students identify, calculate, compare, or draw anything using the concepts they just learned?

### 4. Wrap-up

Finally, did your plan work? Are there any open questions? What was the take home message? The wrap-up section is an opportunity for you and your class to reflect the content of the lesson as a whole. Minimally, you should repeat the central content or let your students do that. If you want to spend more time on a wrap-up, you can reach out to related fields: explain similar problems and related topics, discuss the limitations of a method or concept. Give hints where to learn more. Request feedback from your audience. And say goodbye, of course.

## Conclusions

These are the four basic phases of a teaching unit. In the figure you can see that the warm-up and wrap-up parts are generally shorter than the other two (usually 10-20% each). In a single lesson, you may cycle through the four phases once, or several times for different learning goals. This is why the model in the figure is circular. A single cycle should last at least 45', otherwise the pace might be considered too fast.

For well-balanced teaching, vary the methods between the phases. For instance as a warm-up you could show a video, do a brainstorming session, or run a quiz before introducing content in a classical presentation. The four phases give you a lot of freedom to teach in your own style, but they help you not to forget any essential parts of the learning process.
