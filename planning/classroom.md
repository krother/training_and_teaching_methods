# The Classroom

The position of tables, the lectern, projectors, power sockets, screens etc. is crucial. Tables and laptops are psychological barriers that  both students and teachers use to entrench themselves behind. If there are too many barriers, it is difficult to establish a dialogue.

For a more communicative atmosphere, you should move tables aside if possible. The chairs can be arranged in a circle or half-circle. Of course this will only work if you get rid of your defences as well. Employ students to help with rearranging furniture.
