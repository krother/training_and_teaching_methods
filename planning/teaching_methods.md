The attention of people listening decreases over time. After 20 minutes, many brains switch off unless they have something interesting to do. The trick is to change methods frequently (around every 20 minutes).


## Brainstorming

**Collect a pool of uncriticized ideas**

### Time in class

5 minutes

### Group size

any

### What you need

something to write on

### How it is done

Write an understandable formulation of a new topic on the board. Ask
the students for ideas. Write everything on the board they say. Continue
until they run out of ideas or the board is full. Only after that, add
from your notes.

### Example

For a subject about *“Data”,* the question could be *“What data do
programmers need to store?”.*
