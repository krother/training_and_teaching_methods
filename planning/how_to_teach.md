# How to teach?

As a teacher, your job is to get your students to learn efficiently. You cannot force them to do so; it is always the students who decide whether they learn or not. Likewise, you cannot force children to eat. But you decide what is on the menu, and you can make sure it looks tasty.

Once upon a time, a teacher was a source of information. This role is diminishing. Nowadays, students can find out abundant information on the web in no time. But they need your help to not get lost in that abundance! Your role is that of a *learning facilitator*: Show them a path and walk that path with them.

To a student a new, unknown topic looks at first interesting, but also big and intimidating. So the first thing you should do is to chop it up into small parts the students can digest more easily. They have a right to know what is expecting them.


## Myth debunking

### Common beliefs in academic teaching staff:

* The most efficient and the only practical way to teach a large (>50) class is by lecturing.
* Students will (or at least should) understand and remember everything they are told in a lecture.
* The best use of class time is to transmit information by lecturing; time spent on discussion or other activities is less valuable or wasted.
* The more an instructor covers in a lecture course, the more the students will learn.
* Students will only learn in a course to the extent that the instructor teaches them (presents and explains the material in lectures).
* A detailed syllabus is a better way to convey the content of a course than a set of specific student learning goals.

### Common beliefs of students:

* Lectures are the only format that makes sense for a large class.
* If I just attend class regularly, do the assigned reading with a highlighter, take good notes in class, and review them on my own before the exam, I will learn and retain the course material and get a good grade in the course.
* In a large class, I'm learning most when the instructor is lecturing and I’m taking notes. When an instructor spends class time on discussions or group work rather than presenting the course material, then he is wasting valuable class time.
* The more the instructor covers in a course, the more I will learn and retain from it.
* It is the job of the instructor to teach us, not make us learn on our own.
* A detailed syllabus will be more helpful to me in studying for the exams than a set of student learning goals.



## Teach concepts

**Don't teach facts, teach concepts.**

A concept is an idea that can be applied in multiple contexts to explain and/or predict outcomes.

**Conceptual understanding** is the ability to apply an idea in multiple contexts to explain and/or predict outcomes.

Develop formative assessments for the most important concepts:

* identify concepts to be tested
* identify misconceptions
* construct the assessment
* validate the test (with novices and experts)
* use the test


## Repeating

Repeating content is essential to ensure successful learning. Furthermore, giving students the opportunity to show what they have learned already motivates them. In each seminar, some time should be reserved for repeating the last lessons' material. Repeating content is essential to ensure successful learning.

## Managing the group

A teacher must not make any group member look like an idiot (“to lose their face”). Depending on the cultural context you put the student or yourself into trouble.

This means: Picking people from the group and questioning them, giving nonconstructive feedback after student presentations are absolute no-gos!

## Some other things yet to document

* Anchors
* Weekly projects
* knowledge capacitor
* Prototypes (examples that weave a thread through one or more lessons)
* inductive (concepts -> details -> examples) vs. deductive (example -> detail -> concepts) teaching
