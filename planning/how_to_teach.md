# How to teach?

As a teacher, your job is to get your students to learn efficiently. You cannot force them to do so; it is always the students who decide whether they learn or not. Likewise, you cannot force children to eat. But you decide what is on the menu, and you can make sure it looks tasty.

Once upon a time, a teacher was a source of information. This role is diminishing. Nowadays, students can find out abundant information on the web in no time. But they need your help to not get lost in that abundance! Your role is that of a *learning facilitator*: Show them a path and walk that path with them.

To a student a new, unknown topic looks at first interesting, but also big and intimidating. So the first thing you should do is to chop it up into small parts the students can digest more easily. They have a right to know what is expecting them.

## Preparing lessons

The attention of people listening decreases over time. After 20 minutes, many brains switch off unless they have something interesting to do. The trick is to change methods frequently (around every 20 minutes).

A **syllabus**, a list of the topics, is only the first step in preparation. A properly prepared lesson consists of specific **learning objectives** that you can assess (or ideally your participants can assess themselves).

It is useful to prepare a **lesson plan**, a table listing the topics for a lesson, the methods you are going to use and the time you plan for this.

A Klingon proverb says: “Planning ends with enemy contact.”. Especially when you start teaching, your time estimates will be plain wrong. Be ready to recognize the moment at which to trash your lesson plan and improvise.

## What does a lesson consist of?

A well-prepared lesson contains:

* a list of around 7 key cocepts
* a learning goal
* a problem statement
* a concept map
* data
* media
* learning material
* exercises
* tools (programs, libraries, teaching methods)
* lesson plan

Material prepared along these categories can be used in many ways. Even if you have half of these, the lesson is already very solid. It makes it much easier to modify one component and re-fit the lesson to another situation (more/less time, bigger/smaller/more experienced group).


## The Classroom

The position of tables, the lectern, projectors, power sockets, screens etc. is crucial. Tables and laptops are psychological barriers that  both students and teachers use to entrench themselves behind. If there are too many barriers, it is difficult to establish a dialogue. 

For a more communicative atmosphere, you should move tables aside if possible. The chairs can be arranged in a circle or half-circle. Of course this will only work if you get rid of your defences as well. Employ students to help with rearranging furniture.

## Managing Energy

Create a welcoming atmosphere right from the start.

The way humans work is that they tend to reflect the friendliness and enthusiasm of the leader (you). If a lesson is joyful to you, you will incite the others. If you feel insecure or distracted for whatever reason, it will show as well. It is OK that you are teaching a topic for the first time, and asking for help usually works. But don't tell people why you feel terrible and what bad day you had - that intoxicates the climate.

If you spend some longer period of time with the same people, you normally want to know who they are. In a class, you should at least learn their names. Most students appreciate being adressed by their name. Having everybody introduce himself is an excellent opportunity to probe students' expectations and fears.

If you are sharing handouts, tasks or other material to students, they will get excited and distracted from you immediately. Make sure to tell them what they are expected to do before they receive anything.

Ideally, keep the class in the "flow state" - not too easy, not too difficult. To avoid boredom or frustration. With a heterogeneous group this can be quite challenging.

## Exercises

If your participants need to do something, they need clear instructions.

An example that does not work well:

    Implement the quicksort algorithm.

An example that might work better:

    Complete the quicksort code. Execute the code on the datasets A and B. Measure how long it takes to complete. Compare the performance to Pythons built-in `sort()` function.

## Repeating

Repeating content is essential to ensure successful learning. Furthermore, giving students the opportunity to show what they have learned already motivates them. In each seminar, some time should be reserved for repeating the last lessons' material. Repeating content is essential to ensure successful learning.

## Managing the group

A teacher must not make any group member look like an idiot (“to lose their face”). Depending on the cultural context you put the student or yourself into trouble. 

This means: Picking people from the group and questioning them, giving nonconstructive feedback after student presentations are absolute no-gos!

## Some other things yet to document

* Anchors and Priming
* Weekly projects
- knowledge capacitor
* Prototypes (examples that weave a thread through one or more lessons)
* inductive (concepts -> details -> examples) vs. deductive (example -> detail -> concepts) teaching
