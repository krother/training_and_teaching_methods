# Content Reduction

***How to find out what to include in a concept map***

When teaching academic subjects, a frequent problem is that the field is
very broad, especially if you know it well. For the student, such a high
amount of information can be easily overwhelming.

**Content reduction** is a powerful technique for preparing lessons. It
structures a subject both for you and the students. As a result, you
will obtain a **concept map**, a visual representation of the subject.

Here is how it works:

### 1. Collect topics you wish to cover

Write down all topics that are
necessary to achieve the **learning goal** and that you would like
to cover in the tutorial on a separate sheet of paper. Often, you
can use topics directly from the course **syllabus**.

### 2. Cluster the content

Group the topics, until you have
4-7 clusters. Give each cluster a name. By presenting the clusters,
you give your students **mental boxes** so that they can sort
content more easily. Bear in mind that there is not one single
true clustering.

### 3. Draw a concept map

Visualize your clusters on a separate sheet
of paper as a **mind map**, diagram, or a picture with the clusters
as labels. The concept map can be used as an **outline** of
your lesson.
