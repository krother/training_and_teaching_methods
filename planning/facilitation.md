# Facilitating your group

Once upon a time, a teacher was the main source of information in the classroom. But today, course participants find information on any programming topic or entire courses themselves in no time. In comparison, lecturing is an ineffective method to convey information: You have to guess what information your participants are looking for, prepare it in the right granularity and convey it at the right pace. It's a risky business.

But learning to program is something else than attentively listening and taking notes anyway. To learn it, you need to do it. And this is where the real fun begins. Beginners typically face a lot of practical questions:

* Which Python version should I install?
* Should I use `for` loop, a `while` loop or maybe `break`?
* What do all these controls in my IDE do?
* Which of the 1000 packages/libraries/tools should I learn?
* What is a `UnicodeError`, a `Makefile`, or a `git pull`?
* I have an error message that spans 3 screen pages. Help!

It is easy to get lost in the abundant information. Here, participants need your help. Your role is that of a *learning facilitator*: Show them a path and walk that path with them.

## Welcoming

Create a welcoming atmosphere right from the start.

The way humans work is that they tend to reflect the friendliness and enthusiasm of the leader (you). If a lesson is joyful to you, you will incite the others. If you feel insecure or distracted for whatever reason, it will show as well. It is OK that you are teaching a topic for the first time, and asking for help usually works. But don't tell people why you feel terrible and what bad day you had - that intoxicates the climate.

If you spend some longer period of time with the same people, you normally want to know who they are. In a class, you should at least learn their names. Most students appreciate being adressed by their name. Having everybody introduce himself is an excellent opportunity to probe students' expectations and fears.

## Respect

A teacher must not make any group member look like an idiot (“to lose their face”). Depending on the cultural context you put the student or yourself into trouble.

This means: Picking people from the group and questioning them, giving nonconstructive feedback after student presentations are absolute no-gos!

Respect is to be given to all skill levels: A task that one person does in 5 minutes may take another person several hours. The difference between the two can be as little as 1-2 weeks of experience.
To give respect to both, you must **appreciate progress**.

## Learning Types

One widely used categorization of learning styles is **Fleming's VARK model** (sometimes VAK) which expanded upon earlier Neuro-linguistic programming (VARK) models:

* visual learners
* auditory learners
* reading-writing preference learners
* kinesthetic learners or tactile learners.

Fleming claimed that visual learners have a preference for seeing (think in pictures; visual aids that represent ideas using methods other than words, such as graphs, charts, diagrams, symbols, etc.). Auditory learners best learn through listening (lectures, discussions, tapes, etc.). Tactile/kinesthetic learners prefer to learn via experience—moving, touching, and doing (active exploration of the world; science projects; experiments, etc.). Its use in instruction allows teachers to prepare classes that address each of these areas. Students can also use the model to identify their preferred learning style and maximize their educational experience by focusing on what benefits them the most.

## Managing groups

There are a couple of different **social forms** that you could use in classes:

### Individual assignments
Some students prefer that, because they can organize themselves freely.
However, it also leaves them stuck more easily.
This should not be the only social form you are using.

### Work in pairs
This is probably the easiest to organize.
Give a task to pairs. Make sure the task is *very clear*.

Quite often, the chemistry within some pairs will be much better than in others.
A few people simply can't stand each other.
Strictly limit the time for pair assignments while getting a feeling for a group,

### Group work
Create small groups (2-4 people). Hand out a text or other material. Give a task assignment, e.g. explaing out the method or the main message in the group and presenting it briefly.

There are two important variations of group work: either all groups get **same task** or **different tasks**. The latter gives participants more responsibility and potentially superior results.
The former is less work to organize and generally safer.

Give the same task to each group if you haven't used this social form a lot.

### Group Puzzle

This is a more interesting form that allows you to cover **a lot** of content.
Here is how it works:

#### Preparations

You need:

* a moderately complex task that requires combining multiple topics (e.g. "modify the colors in a photograph")
* 3-4 topics (e.g. *"RGB colors", "modifying Numpy arrays", "reading and writing images", "image formats")
* some reading material for each topic (1-2 pages, an example script etc.)

Ideally, the task is open-ended and tolerates some creative tinkering.

#### Part 1: Task Teams

* Assign people to teams of (3-4) people
* All teams get the same task (a more complex one)
* Let them chat for 5' to clarify the task
* Do a short Q & A
* Announce the topics and ask each group to assign at least one person to each topic.

#### Part 2: Topic Teams

Now comes the puzzle aspect. The teams regroup:

* the people for each topic get together
* they work on the material and work on a **simple** task (e.g. "read the text and create RGB colors for the rainbow")
* let them work on the task for a while (30' at least)
* be ready to troubleshoot

The trick is that every student now carries a lot of responsibility for their own team.
At the same time, they are never alone!

#### Part 3: Coming back

Finally, everybody goes back to their original team:

* everybody summarizes what they learned to their teammates
* start solving the task
* give them plenty of time for that

Following the idea 'the best teacher is someone who just learned himself.' Course trainers orchestrated the process.

### How to assign pairs / groups

Try any of the following:

* use an obvious criterion (location in the classroom)
* randomize (drawing colored blips from a bag, using the Zoom Breakout funtionality, ``random.choice()`` etc.)
* Let students self-organize (risky if there are outsiders or tensions in the group; less risky with groups of 4+)

Do not fidget around and try to predict good groups by yourself. You'll probably be wrong anyway.

## Managing Energy

If you are sharing handouts, tasks or other material to students, they will get excited and distracted from you immediately. Make sure to tell them what they are expected to do before they receive anything.

The attention of people listening decreases over time. After 20 minutes, many brains switch off unless they have something interesting to do. The trick is to change methods frequently (around every 20 minutes).

----

## Motivation

Ideally, keep the class in the "flow state" - not too easy, not too difficult. To avoid boredom or frustration. With a heterogeneous group this can be quite challenging.

----

## Brainstorming

**Collect a pool of uncriticized ideas**

### Time in class

5 minutes

### Group size

any

### What you need

something to write on

### How it is done

Write an understandable formulation of a new topic on the board. Ask
the students for ideas. Write everything on the board they say. Continue
until they run out of ideas or the board is full. Only after that, add
from your notes.

### Example

For a subject about *“Data”,* the question could be *“What data do
programmers need to store?”.*
