# Facilitating your group

Once upon a time, a teacher was the main source of information in the classroom. But today, course participants find information on any programming topic or entire courses themselves in no time. In comparison, lecturing is an ineffective method to convey information: You have to guess what information your participants are looking for, prepare it in the right granularity and convey it at the right pace. It's a risky business.

But learning to program is something else than attentively listening and taking notes anyway. To learn it, you need to do it. And this is where the real fun begins. Beginners typically face a lot of practical questions:

* Which Python version should I install?
* Should I use `for` loop, a `while` loop or maybe `break`?
* What do all these controls in my IDE do?
* Which of the 1000 packages/libraries/tools should I learn?
* What is a `UnicodeError`, a `Makefile`, or a `git pull`?
* I have an error message that spans 3 screen pages. Help!

It is easy to get lost in the abundant information. Here, participants need your help. Your role is that of a *learning facilitator*: Show them a path and walk that path with them.

## Welcoming

Create a welcoming atmosphere right from the start.

The way humans work is that they tend to reflect the friendliness and enthusiasm of the leader (you). If a lesson is joyful to you, you will incite the others. If you feel insecure or distracted for whatever reason, it will show as well. It is OK that you are teaching a topic for the first time, and asking for help usually works. But don't tell people why you feel terrible and what bad day you had - that intoxicates the climate.

If you spend some longer period of time with the same people, you normally want to know who they are. In a class, you should at least learn their names. Most students appreciate being adressed by their name. Having everybody introduce himself is an excellent opportunity to probe students' expectations and fears.

## Respect

A teacher must not make any group member look like an idiot (“to lose their face”). Depending on the cultural context you put the student or yourself into trouble.

This means: Picking people from the group and questioning them, giving nonconstructive feedback after student presentations are absolute no-gos!


## Skill levels

advanced vs. beginners, homogenous vs. mixed

## Learning Types

One widely used categorization of learning styles is **Fleming's VARK model** (sometimes VAK) which expanded upon earlier Neuro-linguistic programming (VARK) models:

* visual learners
* auditory learners
* reading-writing preference learners
* kinesthetic learners or tactile learners.

Fleming claimed that visual learners have a preference for seeing (think in pictures; visual aids that represent ideas using methods other than words, such as graphs, charts, diagrams, symbols, etc.). Auditory learners best learn through listening (lectures, discussions, tapes, etc.). Tactile/kinesthetic learners prefer to learn via experience—moving, touching, and doing (active exploration of the world; science projects; experiments, etc.). Its use in instruction allows teachers to prepare classes that address each of these areas. Students can also use the model to identify their preferred learning style and maximize their educational experience by focusing on what benefits them the most.


## Managing groups


### Group work
Create small groups (2-4 people). Hand out a text or other material. Give a task assignment, e.g. explaing out the method or the main message in the group and presenting it briefly.

group puzzle:
covering 4 different subjects [PUZZLE FIGURE]: alignments, imaging, plots, R. Each group got a few example scripts, an exercise to implement, and a PDF as a reference. Worked independently with small pieces of advice. Then came back to the original group and explained what they had learned to their colleagues. Following the idea 'the best teacher is someone who just learned himself.' Course trainers orchestrated the process.

## Managing Energy

If you are sharing handouts, tasks or other material to students, they will get excited and distracted from you immediately. Make sure to tell them what they are expected to do before they receive anything.

The attention of people listening decreases over time. After 20 minutes, many brains switch off unless they have something interesting to do. The trick is to change methods frequently (around every 20 minutes).

## Motivation

Ideally, keep the class in the "flow state" - not too easy, not too difficult. To avoid boredom or frustration. With a heterogeneous group this can be quite challenging.



## Asking Questions

### Fact-based questions

*“Which software is most commonly used for creating spreadsheets?"*

* answer is right or wrong
* dangerous (not stimulating up to intimidating)
* work better during repeating sessions

### Opinion-based questions

*"What is your opinion on Excel?"*

* safe
* everybody can answer them
* reduce anxiety
* answers may lack substance
* is a 'temperature check'

### Comparison-based questions

*"How would you compare Excel and OpenOffice?"*

* more substance
* complex
* encourage discussion

### Experience-based questions

*“What have you done with Excel so far?"*

* safe
* connect course contents to the real world
* motivating

### Case-history-based questions

*“You have a table containing 1000 rows and 5 columns. You need to show the most frequently occurring elements for each column. How can you show this information in one diagram?"*

* very complex
* answer requires application of skills

### Questions guided at single participants

* very risky and discouraging. Don't do it!
* work better if presented as a round of questions to everybody, quiz etc.
* if you need to assign questions to single participants, use a random mechanism.
* if you ask a question, tell the name at the end, so that the other participants will think, too.

### Overhead question

directed to everybody

* not risky at all.
* asymmetric participation is typical.

### Relay question

passing the same question around from one person to the other.

* good to involve everybody.
* gets boring with more than 10 participants

### Reverse technique

*“What would you say?”*

* participant asks the question
* you redirect the question back to the trainee or relay to the group.

## Brainstorming

**Collect a pool of uncriticized ideas**

### Time in class

5 minutes

### Group size

any

### What you need

something to write on

### How it is done

Write an understandable formulation of a new topic on the board. Ask
the students for ideas. Write everything on the board they say. Continue
until they run out of ideas or the board is full. Only after that, add
from your notes.

### Example

For a subject about *“Data”,* the question could be *“What data do
programmers need to store?”.*
