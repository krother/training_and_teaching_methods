Tell everybody write down something about himself, e.g.<span style="font-style: italic;"> "I have 2 cats"</span>. Collect the cards, shuffle them and read each statement aloud. Have the rest of the team guess who it is.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Caution:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">This method requires a group where everybody knows each other - it does not make much sense otherwise.</span><br><br>I used this guessing game for starting a programming course which was the very first lecture in English for both the group and myself. We were quite nervous at first, but the guessing helped to break the ice.<br></div>
