<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the last two days, I was at the annual meeting of the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.biotnet.org/\">Bioinformatics Training Network (BTN)</a> at the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/\">EBI </a>near Cambridge. There, a group of 21 trainers and training coordinators from Europe and beyond met for mutual support. Since your taxes paid our food &amp; travel, you have a right to know what the BTN does for your bioinformatics training.<br></div><br><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. </span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.biotnet.org/\">The BTN website</a> contains a <a target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.biotnet.org/trainers-organisers\">catalog of 50 trainers</a>, listing training topics and location. There is a repository of <a target=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.biotnet.org/training-materials\">training materials</a> in case you are preparing a training event yourself. Finally, it is a channel to find upcoming training events and get into touch with trainers directly.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Publications on training bioinformatics.</span> In 2010, we <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562256\">reported challenges</a> that bioinformatics trainers face, and proposed steps to overcome them. In 2011, we followed up with a <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22110242\">paper on the BTN website</a>.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. When you are organizing a conference or course</span>, distributing the announcement can be a pain in the back. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Raphael Jimenez</span> presented <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://iann.pro/node/4\">IANN</a>, a system that collects and distributes announcements to a number of websites. Submitting a conference can be done by a web form, and displaying current announcements is worth looking at in more detail. The technology is Drupal-based as well.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. Large life science organizations</span> with big budgets such as <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.imi.europa.eu/\">IMI</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.emtrain.eu/\">EMTRAIN</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.elixir-europe.org/\">ELIXIR</a> have training components as well. We discussed, how trainers could e.g. adopt the quality assurance policy from IMI in order to raise the quality of training in the long run. The IMI has a full page of guidelines, including:<br></div><ul><li>Setting clear learning objectives.</li><li>Assessing trainees after a training.</li><li>Giving credit points according to a transparent scheme.</li><li>Documenting their QA policy.</li><li>... and several more.<br></li></ul><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The main goal of these QA guidelines is to make trainings in the IMI course catalogs more credible. If you have an accreditation already (e.g. you are a university), getting there is considerably easier. For a smaller organization (like myself *g*), it probably does not make much sense to go through all the formal requirements, but making goals more visible and having a QA policy are definitely something I want to work on.<br><br>Our chairwoman, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Vicky Schneider</span>, did a great job to moderate an exciting meeting. We had lots of discussions and fun work sessions with <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.post-it.com\">colourful post-its</a> for voting, and <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\" href=\"http://www.dickblick.com/products/mr-sketch-scented-markers/\">Mr. Sketch scented markers</a> - items that go straight to my wishlist.<br></div><br>
