### Time in class

### Preparation time
1'

### Group size
3-30

### What you need
whiteboard or flipchart

### How it is done
Draw an empty Scrabble board.

Write one keyword in the middle of the board. Ask the group to suggest other keywords in a crossword-like manner.

As an extra incentive, you may add some bonus fields along the edges.

### Comments

The exercise is not to be taken too seriously. You don't need to enforce rules of normal corsswords meticulously. You don't need to stick precisely to a grid when drawing characters either.
