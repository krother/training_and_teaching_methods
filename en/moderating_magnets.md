# Moderating with Magnets

![Magnets](images/magnets.png)

When moderating an interactive teaching session, a huge **pin board** is the visualization tool that I dream of. However, most classrooms don't have one. Period. Do you need to resign from sophisticated moderation methods, then?

Fortunately, all whiteboards, many blackboards, and the back sides of a flipchart contain solid iron. Thus, you can use **magnets** to attach material you would otherwise use pins for. You can do useful things with magnets: Attach **prepared pictures** on-the-fly or things created during the session (e.g. [collecting cards](http://www.academis.eu/posts/collect_cards_to_open_your_lesson">). The magnets let you **move around cards and other elements**, so you can cluster items, highlight key points, or create a live visualization. Most of all, you don't end up in the sticky tape hell when you have magnets at hand.

However, there are some pitfalls to avoid:

* Get good, strong magnets of 3-4 cm diameter. Weak magnets ruin your day.
* Before your session, align the magnets on the side of the board. This avoids that you play with them in your hands.
* Never, ever pull a magnet across the surface of a whiteboard. The damage is more severe than a permanent marker.
* Keep the magnets separate from your electronic equipment, especially your laptops hard disk.
* Don't mix colors, they confuse. Just simple black or white. However, I keep a single big red magnet to highlight things on the board - e.g. the current point of an agenda.

With these things in mind, magnets are a useful little helper that make your day at the board a pleasant one. I got hooked to the electrifying power right before a magnet attaches. Have you tried it already?
