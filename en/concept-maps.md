# Concept Maps

**A concept map is a structured visualization of a topic showing no more than seven concepts.**

Humans gather most information visually. Therefore, a visual presentation of a subject facilitates understanding. A key point in lesson preparation is to prepare a visual overview of the subject. I refer to such visualizations as **Concept Maps**. 

Concept maps can be depicted as mind maps, diagrams, flowcharts, or use a visual metaphor:

A good concept map limits itself to the most important aspects of a field. There should be no more than 5-9 points in one map, because of the **working memory limit* of seven plus/minus two** (as described by George Miller). If have more concepts and need more details, you can build an information hierarchy. Zoom into one particular aspect of your concept map and explain it on a separate diagram. Alternatively you can annotate the initial map further as soon as your students have digested the initial map.

A concept map serves many purposes: introducing a subject, showing an overview, repeating, displaying what a certain part of a tutorial focuses on etc. A well-crafted concept map serves as the backbone of your teaching unit.
