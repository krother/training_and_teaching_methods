#### Summary
collect cards with feedback in a box

#### Preparation time
none

#### Group size
up to 30

#### What do you need?
small pieces of paper, a box or hat

#### How it is done

Write an open question on the board, e.g.: 

*“What would you like to learn tomorrow?”*

Share small pieces of paper among the students. Give them some time to write down something and collect the paper pieces in the box. Evaluate the answers. If you are collecting feedback, start reading the answers only **after all students are out of sight**.

You can use this feedback techinique to collect ideas and suggestions from a passive group. For instance, when your lessons start very late, when students have a lot of respect towards you, or when there is a language barrier. The method also helps if your group is heterogeneous or dominated by a few active trainees.

I often use this kind of poll for getting feedback after the first few days of a course, and prepare the rest of the course to the answers. It is a foolproof method that you can apply spontaneously.
