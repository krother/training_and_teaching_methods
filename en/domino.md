# Domino

**Repeat familiar concepts.**

### Time in class
15'

### Preparation time
10'

### Group size
2-15

### What you need

* cards (A4 paper cut by three). Two cards more than students. 
* magnets or sticky tape to attach cards on the board.

### How it is done

Write concepts from the last lesson on the cards (1-2 words), Each student gets a card at random. An additional card gets attached to the board or laid on the ground. Anyone who can explain a connection from his card to an already attached one may place his card in a domino-like manner. Place the first card and explanation yourself. This process continues, until everybody has placed his card. Students may cooperate on difficult topics. 

### Comments

Alternatively (and a nice set-up for an entire lesson) the class can sit in a circle with the empty space in the middle for the Domino.

### Example

In a class on Object-Oriented Programming for beginners', possible concepts are *'Class', 'method', 'inheritance', 'attribute' etc.*
