# Construct well-balanced Teaching Units

What is the optimal method for experimental research? Obviously, the answer depends on the subject and on the research hypothesis pursued by your research group. In teaching and training it is the same: Many factors determine how the optimal teaching unit should be structured, such as:

* the subject
* the learning objective
* the group size and their background
* the training room and available equipment
* the time frame
* and of course your personal style as a teacher.

Therefore there is no single best approach, but literally hundreds. The overall setting determines which teaching methods will work best in practice. But how can you systematically construct a teaching unit then?

Here, I propose a model consisting of four phases. They provide you with a scaffolding that give you a safe structure to construct quality teaching units from 45 minutes to full days. In each well-built seminar and practical course, you will find the four phases **warm-up, introduce content, apply content,** and **wrap-up.

# 1. Warm-up

Here, you invite students mentally into your class. You motivate them to learn about the subject and make them ready to think, if necessary (and it should always be necessary). To motivate trainees you can connect the topic at hand to their present knowledge or present a single example of the problem at hand. You can explain the learning goal or give an overview. To make students more active, do a warm-up exercise. Warming up includes as simple things as saying hello (imagine a lecture without; I was told it is very awkward).

### 2. Introduce content

Now you deliver the new content in bite-sized chunks. Your main job as a teacher is not to convey all the facts, as frequently misconceived, but to provide a structure for the topic. Immerse yourself in the structure of your subject, show it, tell it, and repeat the basic concepts and categories again and again. Make it visual. And of course, add the facts, but you don't have to say everything. Your students have not only ears, but also eyes and fingers. A proper piece of text and a figure can provide as much information as a deck of slides.

### 3. Apply content

Give students a chance to apply their new knowledge actively. They need to experience that it is good for something, otherwise adult brains tend to classify it as 'irrelevant' and kick it out the next night (in contrast to children who store everything by default). So, what is the subject you are teaching good for? Can your students do something with it right away? If for some reason a real-world application is not possible (e.g. when you do particle physics), can your students identify, calculate, compare, or draw anything using the concepts they just learned?

### 4. Wrap-up

Finally, did your plan work? Are there any open questions? What was the take home message? The wrap-up section is an opportunity for you and your class to reflect the content of the lesson as a whole. Minimally, you should repeat the central content or let your students do that. If you want to spend more time on a wrap-up, you can reach out to related fields: explain similar problems and related topics, discuss the limitations of a method or concept. Give hints where to learn more. Request feedback from your audience. And say goodbye, of course.

These are the four basic phases of a teaching unit. In the figure you can see that the warm-up and wrap-up parts are generally shorter than the other two (usually 10-20% each). In a single lesson, you may cycle through the four phases once, or several times for different learning goals. This is why the model in the figure is circular. A single cycle should last at least 45', otherwise the pace might be considered too fast. 

For well-balanced teaching, vary the methods between the phases. For instance as a warm-up you could show a video, do a brainstorming session, or run a quiz before introducing content in a classical presentation. The four phases give you a lot of freedom to teach in your own style, but they help you not to forget any essential parts of the learning process.
