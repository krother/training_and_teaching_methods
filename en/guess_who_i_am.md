# Introduction Round: Guess who I am

**Learn to know your group**

### Time in class
10'

### Preparation time
none

### Group size
5-15

### What you need
small paper cards

### How it is done
Share the cards. Ask everybody to write down something about themselves, e.g. *"I have 2 cats"*
Collect the cards, shuffle them and read each statement aloud. Have the rest of the team guess who it is.

### Comments

**Caution:** This method requires a group where everybody knows each other - it does not make much sense otherwise.

I used this guessing game for starting a programming course in a *first contact* situation. It was my first course in English, it was their first course in English. We were quite nervous at first, but the guessing helped to break the ice.
