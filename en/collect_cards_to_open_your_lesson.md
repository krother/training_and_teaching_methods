# Collect Cards to Open Your Lesson

**brainstorming with cards on one topic**

### Time in class
10'

### Preparation time
5'

### Group size
2-25

### What you need

* thick pens
* moderation cards (1-3 per student)
* a place to put up the cards. A big pin board and pins work best, but a whiteboard plus painters' tape will do as well.

### How it is done

Ask an open question on your topic, e.g. *"What teaching methods do you know?"*. Write the question on the board or use a prepared slide. Share the moderation cards to pairs of students. Give them up to five minutes to collect their thoughts. Then collect the cards, read them aloud, and attach them on the board. If you get duplicates, put them up as well (to avoid trashing someones input). You can ask a volunteer to help you with the attaching.

At the beginning of a lesson, this method is a powerful opener, because it connects to existing knowledge. You can use it in a follow-up lesson to repeat content or start something new by connecting to everyday experience. Just make sure your question triggers more than one answer.

### Comments

The extra effort with the cards is justified only if you use the resulting cards during your lesson. Possible continuations are to cluster the cards on the board, explore a few of them deeper, or add a new conceptual layer to them. For instance, if your new topic in the above example were "lesson planning" you could connect the above example to a new topic with the question *"In what parts of a lesson are the methods applicable?"* The cards can be nicely sorted into categories of the new topic.

Collecting cards is a basic, very formidable moderation method. You can also use it to find about your students' expectations or simply to introduce everybody. Handling the cards is not completely straightforward, there are small pitfalls such as getting your students to write readable. As a moderator, you can write the cards yourselves, but to activate your class it is better if they get moving.
