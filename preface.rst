Preface
=======

This book introduces you to the craft of teaching programming.
I wrote it for developers who teach occasionally and for full-time teachers
without a formal background in education. This book takes you on a tour
of *teaching practices and skills*. You can use the book as a guide to
create a course from scratch or fish for ideas to spice up your classes.

Some of the practices and skills make your lessons more engaging and
fun. Others will be invisible to your students, but help them learn.
Most of them make your work easier, so that you can focus on what
matters â€“ your students. All chapters cover time-tested techniques that
I collected teaching coding, data science and many other subjects during
the past 20 years.

I hope this book helps you become a great programming teacher.
