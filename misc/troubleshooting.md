## What are the 10 most important things to remember?

* Enjoy teaching
* Say hello
* Have a plan
* Convey a structure
* Be ready to scrap the plan
* Dress aproppriately
* Ask students for their expectations
* If a student comes to you, they always have a serious issue
* Leave no one behind. People will pull each other through
* You don't know everything

## What are the biggest don'ts?

* don't get personal, ever
* don't use provocative or toxic phrases
* don't use discriminative or pejorative language
* avoid the words *"maybe", "just", "one could" etc.*
* avoid talking for more than 20`
* don't criticise participants's contributions
* never make anyone lose face in the class
* never discuss teaching methods during the course
* never insist on anyone to say something 
* never skip repeating

## How do I get everyone on board?

* use Round Robin and similar methods
* pair and group assignments (short / sparingly)
* use brainstorming + affinity grouping
* open questions
* discuss questions in pairs before publicly
* work in pairs instead of alone
* address pre-knowledge of participants
* increase psychological safety
* alternate passive and active phases
* talk less
* address concerns, if participants do not participate voluntarily

## How to deal with conflicts inside the group

* round where everybody says something
* establish ground rules, e.g.:
* do not interrupt others
* listen
* NO justifications
* everybody is heard
* everybody tells things from their own perspective ("in my opinion..")
* limit speaking time
* summarize pros and cons, propose solutions

## How to deal with verbal attacks directed at you

* *"Shields up"*, do not react, let the attack pass
* redirect criticism to the group (*"do you share that concern?")
* focus on positive people, look at them!
* stick to your structure
* understand the critic
* talk to them one-on-one (but do not announce it)

## How to deal with non-participants

* don't say *"maybe"*
* address disturbance
* talk to them one-on-one (but do not announce it)
* state your point clearly
* understand them
* avoid loaded terms ("roleplay", "groupwork" etc.)

## How to deal with participants that knows each other well

* introduce yourself
* collecting expectations is super important here
* distrust your first impression
* keep the introductions short
* have participants introduce each other 
* let them ask questions about you

## How to create a top-notch training experience

* play music during the breaks (watch IP)
* decorate the training room
* use a strong metaphor
* draw a super nice poster
* address all senses
