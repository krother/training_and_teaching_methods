# Energizers

## Murmur

Let participants discuss a question, task, problem for 2 minutes among each other before a discourse in class.

This is a very versatile technique that activates your class in many situations.

## YMCA

* one person names a concept from the course and makes a gesture/move
* the others repeat the gesture
* the second person repeats the previous moves and adds one to it
* repeat until you have a sequence of 7-8 moves

## Scaling

Create a scale in the room using cards with numbers (0/25/50/75/100) or words.

Ask a question (*"how much do you know about programming?", "how far away from here do you live?"*)

Participants sort themselves along the scale.

You can ask multiple questions or *"interview"* a few participants to describe their position.

This works great a the beginning of the course or as a feedback method.

## Binary count

Count to 15 using your fingers.

## Knot

Four people hold a thread or rope in one hand. Create a knot in the middle without letting go of the thread.

## Fastball

Pass a ball around so that it touches every hand once. Use a stopwatch to measure the time. Repeat a few time and optimize.

## Microwave

A super quick energizer. The microwave has three levels:

1. **hmmmm** - Spread your arms in front of you, so they´re parallel to the ground and move your fingers like starting a wave and hum monotonously.
2. **HMMMM** - like level 1 and aditionally turn around once.
3. **Bing!** - Jump, raise your arm, point to the ceiling and make a noise like „bing!“

## Horserace

Tap your hands on your upper legs. Give commands like *"go left", "faster", "jump"* for about a minute.

## Clapping
Pass a *"clapping signal"* around in a circle. Clapping twice changes the direction. Making a mistake means you leave the circle.

## Ball
Pass a ball in a given sequence arond in the room. Add more balls.
