# Why we need so many training methods?

How to build a training session using some of the methods above? For sure, you cannot just throw a few training methods together randomly. Is there an ideal arrangement for a particular subject. Unfortunately there is not.

You cannot simply copy the plan from one training to another. Here is why:

* No two training objectives are the same. Your field evolves, and so do training contents.
* No two trainees are the same. Some know exactly what they want, others want to be entertained.
* No two groups are the same. Groups can be homogeneous, heterogeneous, lively, silent etc.
* No two training rooms are the same. Moving a single piece of furniture can influence the training climate considerably.
* No two trainers are the same. All of you have their individual preferences.

This is why every lesson is a unique performance. Of course, a well-crafted lesson plan helps, and many things are reproducible. But be ready to improvise.

Each training is a new invention! This is what makes training so rewarding.
