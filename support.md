Beginners typically face a lot of practical questions:

* Which Python version should I install?
* Should I use `for` loop, a `while` loop or maybe `break`?
* What do all these controls in my IDE do?
* Which of the 1000 packages/libraries/tools should I learn?
* What is a `UnicodeError`, a `Makefile`, or a `git pull`?
* I have an error message that spans 3 screen pages. Help!

It is easy to get lost in the abundant information. Here, participants need your help. Your role is that of a *learning facilitator*: Show them a path and walk that path with them.

## Welcoming

Create a welcoming atmosphere right from the start.


The way humans work is that they tend to reflect the friendliness and enthusiasm of the leader (you). If a lesson is joyful to you, you will incite the others. If you feel insecure or distracted for whatever reason, it will show as well. It is OK that you are teaching a topic for the first time, and asking for help usually works. But don't tell people why you feel terrible and what bad day you had - that intoxicates the climate.

If you spend some longer period of time with the same people, you normally want to know who they are. In a class, you should at least learn their names. Most students appreciate being adressed by their name. Having everybody introduce himself is an excellent opportunity to probe students' expectations and fears.

## Respect

A teacher must not make any group member look like an idiot (“to lose their face”). Depending on the cultural context you put the student or yourself into trouble.

This means: Picking people from the group and questioning them, giving nonconstructive feedback after student presentations are absolute no-gos!

Respect is to be given to all skill levels: A task that one person does in 5 minutes may take another person several hours. The difference between the two can be as little as 1-2 weeks of experience.
To give respect to both, you must **appreciate progress**.

## Learning Types

One widely used categorization of learning styles is **Fleming's VARK model** (sometimes VAK) which expanded upon earlier Neuro-linguistic programming (VARK) models:

* visual learners
* auditory learners
* reading-writing preference learners
* kinesthetic learners or tactile learners.

Fleming claimed that visual learners have a preference for seeing (think in pictures; visual aids that represent ideas using methods other than words, such as graphs, charts, diagrams, symbols, etc.). Auditory learners best learn through listening (lectures, discussions, tapes, etc.). Tactile/kinesthetic learners prefer to learn via experience—moving, touching, and doing (active exploration of the world; science projects; experiments, etc.). Its use in instruction allows teachers to prepare classes that address each of these areas. Students can also use the model to identify their preferred learning style and maximize their educational experience by focusing on what benefits them the most.
