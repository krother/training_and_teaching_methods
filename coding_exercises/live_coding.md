# Live coding

According to *Greg Wilson*, live coding is the essence for any programming course.
Seeing live coding, as opposed to seeing the finished code, transfers many key skills like debugging and seeing that teachers make lots of mistakes, too.

You can do a live coding session in several ways:

### Warm-up coding

Type something easy for 5-10 minutes that everyone can follow along.

### Coding lecture

Introduce a new concept by writing a new program.
