# Project Presentations

*Avoid long and boring presentations.*

When you would like to give students room to present, this can be one of the best parts of the course, or the worst.

Here are some ground rules to avoid the latter:

## Time limit

Limiting time is the most important one. Make clear what the time limit is.

Lightning talks

## Announce the talks early

Let your participants know early that they will be presenting. Also announce  what you expect from presenters. Make the rules visible so that they can be read clearly by everyone.

## Example rules:

1. A presentation is 5-10 minutes long.
2. Students decide what they would like to share
3. The text is to be spoken freely, not read from paper.
4. No handouts required.

## Enforce the rules

If the group is bigger or goes overtime notoriously, use a stopwatch. Better, put 1-2 participants in charge of timekeeping.


## Feedback

*Get immediate feedback on presentations from peers.*

If one objective is to train presenting and you have
a friendly and non-competitive group/team atmosphere, you may encourage peer feedback.

The easiest to encourage constructive, useful feedback is to handout small evaluation cards that can be discreetly shared with the presenter. Reserve space for **positive aspects** and **suggestions for improvement**.
