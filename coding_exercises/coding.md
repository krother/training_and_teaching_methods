# Coding

### Refactoring

Clean up an example program together.

### Break the code

Collect various ways to break a program.

## Code Reviews

Like in software engineering, code reviews are an essential skill.

* Read code in a team and assess readability, structure etc.
* Peer review (participants review each others projects)
* Review code of your participants and provide feedback (time-consuming)

## Reduced examples

Writing a program from scratch is difficult. It works better to provide a **reduced example**, where a clear problem-solving strategy is made available:

* code with gaps		
* sort code lines		
* sort code blocks
* fix unindented code
* empty function headers
* sequence of small tasks
* pseudocode
* fix buggy code
