## Code Reviews

In software engineering, code reviews are an essential skill. It is a useful technique in teaching as well.

* Read code in a team and assess readability, structure etc.
* Peer review (participants review each others projects)
* Review code of your participants and provide feedback (time-consuming)

## Refactoring

Clean up an example program together.

## Coding tools

I find tools like git, pytest, Docker, Travis etc more difficult to teach than programming. Mostly you would follow a step-by-step instruction to get everything running.

A crucial part in these is to make clear *why* a tool is useful. Start with the problem. You could even create a table with different engineering/maintenance problems and fill in solutions together.

I think the key is to learn a few techniques well before adding others.
