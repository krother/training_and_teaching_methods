# Coding Kata

A **Coding Kata** is a coding challenge to rehearse coding skills together.

A **Coding Kata** could be:

* Write a *"Hello, World"* program
* Calculate numbers from the *Fibonacci series*
* Find the exit from a maze

## How to run a Kata?

**Summary:**

1. Pick a challenge
2. Set a time limit
3. Start working in pairs
4. Review results together

### 1. Pick a Challenge

* Go to [www.academis.eu](http://www.academis.eu/) and pick a challenge from one of the sections.
* If you do this for the first time, the *"Postcard"* and *"Baby Name Generator"* are easy to facilitate.
* Read through the challenge and make sure you understand the task
* Announce the task to the group
* Send them a link to the challenge

### 2. Set a time limit

* A good time limit is between 10 minutes (for a one-star or warmup exercise) and 45 minutes (a three-star challenge) in a group of beginners.
* Announce the time limit
* Make sure the timer is clearly visible

### 3. Start working in pairs

* Randomly assign participants to pairs (use memory cards or similar)
* Give a strong, audible *"Lets GO!"* signal.
* Start the timer
* Towards the end, announce the time left

### 4. Review results together

* Ask every group to share their code on a public channel (git, Slack)
* Project the code on a screen
* Ask them to explain their code and/or give a live demo

## Variations

There are several ways to run a Coding Kata:

### Classroom Challenge

* Present the task.
* Give them time (5-15 minutes) to think about it.
* Wait for suggestions from participants.
* Type in what they tell you to type.
* Guide them towards the answer, take over when they get stuck.

*this is safer to run but less satisfying for the group*

### Hotseat Kata

* Place two chairs in the front at a computer connected to a screen
* Present the task
* Explain what is going to happen
* Ask two volunteers to take seats at the chairs
* One is the pilot (typing), the other is the copilot (assisting)
* After 5 minutes, the pilot is released, the copilot is promoted, and a new person fills in the empty seat.
* Repeat for the entire time box

## Where does the word "Kata" come from?

A **Kata** is a well-defined ritualized exercise. In martial arts, the student is expected to perform an exact sequence of movements. Programmers have borrowed the concept for coding exercises.

Unfortunately we don't have an established system where you get colored belts (or hoodies or base caps) after completing a certain Kata. We should work on that.
