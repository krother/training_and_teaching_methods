Questions in Code Reviews
-------------------------
Questions are a great tool to review the outcome of an exercise.
Let one of them share a solution and talk about the code together.

It is useful to prepare 3-5 questions, e.g.:

1. Does every table need a PRIMARY KEY?
2. What COPY command did you use to load the data?
3. What advantages does SQL have over Python?
4. What difficulties did you face?

These questions help you to guide the discussion.
Questions 1-2 focus on facts. Question 3 connects to other fields. Question 4 reviews the process.
It is good to mix question types.

Questions are a great backup if the students don't come up with questions on their own or got terribly stuck.
You might write the questions into the exercise so that students can prepare and come up with quality answers.
