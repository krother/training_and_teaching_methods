**Coding exercises are a fun thing until you get stuck.**

There are many reasons to prevent your participants from getting stuck as much as possible:

First, you cannot possibly help everybody with everything.

Second, not being in the flow of programming wastes valuable classroom time.

Third, participants react very differently to problems in coding. Some ask for help immediately. Some gnaw away at the problem for a long time. Some refuse to accept help. Some get frustrated easily.

Of course, students need to learn how to get unstuck by themselves. Strategies to teach that skill include:

* take a difficult code example and get unstuck together
* show examples of typical bugs and discuss how to solve them
* keep a list of typical bugs and expand it

Ideally, strategies to get unstuck could be a separate lesson.


Exercises are an essential part of many teaching situations. Here, four
different approaches will be explained briefly. They apply to exercises
carried out in a 'dry' environment: computer classes, calculations,
working with data etc.

## Code Reviews

In software engineering, code reviews are an essential skill. It is a useful technique in teaching as well.

* Read code in a team and assess readability, structure etc.
* Peer review (participants review each others projects)
* Review code of your participants and provide feedback (time-consuming)


## Refactoring

Clean up an example program together.

Provide clear instructions: pylint, tests etc.
