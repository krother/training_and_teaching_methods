# Debugging

Of course, students need to learn how to get unstuck by themselves. Strategies to teach that skill include:

* take a difficult code example and get unstuck together
* show examples of typical bugs and discuss how to solve them
* keep a list of typical bugs and expand it

Ideally, strategies to get unstuck could be a separate lesson.



Exercises are an essential part of many teaching situations. Here, four
different approaches will be explained briefly. They apply to exercises
carried out in a 'dry' environment: computer classes, calculations,
working with data etc.

## Code Reviews

In software engineering, code reviews are an essential skill. It is a useful technique in teaching as well.

* Read code in a team and assess readability, structure etc.
* Peer review (participants review each others projects)
* Review code of your participants and provide feedback (time-consuming)
