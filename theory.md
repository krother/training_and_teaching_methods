# Theory

COMPETENCE-BASED-LEARNING:
- divide your subject into units according to 3 dimensions:
1st dimension: topics (Python basics, advanced Python patterns, Bio libraries, useful modules, SoftDev)
2nd dimension: difficulty (I, II, III)
3rd dimension: Competences, e.g.:
    * carry out experiments: observe, protocol etc
    * invent experiments: original thinking, formulating hypotheses
    * communicate: display results, explain, summarize
    * orient: find useful methods / get overview / explore unknown technologies
    * evaluate: rank, discuss, criticise
- now, organize your course in such a way that each exercise covers a different coordinate in this 3D-space.

- Curricular concepts: Case-based learning, problem-based learning, hands-on training, problem spaces

PROBLEM SPACE:
- BioPrinciples + DataSets + Analysis tools.
- prepare a problem space for each subject

Other
- East-West teaching culture
- Gender issues.


John D. N. Dionisio, Kam D. Dahlquist: Improving the computer science in bioinformatics through open source pedagogy. SIGCSE Bulletin 40(2): 115-119 (2008)

Bioinformatics relies more than ever on information technologies. This pressures scientists to keep up with software development best practices. However, traditional computer science curricula do not necessarily expose students to collaborative and long-lived software development. Using open source principles, practices, and tools forms an effective pedagogy for software development best practices. This paper reports on a bioinformatics teaching framework implemented through courses introducing computer science students to the field. The courses led to an initial product release consisting of software and an Escherichia coli K12 GenMAPP Gene Database, within a total "incubation time" of six months. (1)



John D. N. Dionisio, Caskey L. Dickson, Stephanie E. August, Philip M. Dorin, Ray Toal: An open source software culture in the undergraduate computer science curriculum. SIGCSE Bulletin 39(2): 70-74 (2007)

Open source software has made inroads into mainstream computing where it was once the territory of software altruists, and the open source culture of technological collegiality and accountability may benefit education as well as industry. This paper describes the Recourse project, which seeks to transform the computer science undergraduate curriculum through teaching methods based on open source principles, values, ethics, and tools. Recourse differs from similar projects by bringing the open source culture into the curriculum comprehensively, systematically, and institutionally. The current state of the project is described, and initial results from a pilot exercise are presented.(1)
